## Levels of Measurement {#sec-levelsOfMeasurement}

It is important to know the levels of measurement of your data, because the level(s) of measurement of your data constrain the types of comparisons and analyses that you can meaningfully perform.
There are four levels of measurement that any variable can have:

- nominal
- ordinal
- interval
- ratio

Each is described below:

### Nominal {#sec-nominal}

A variable is considered nominal if it is composed of qualitative classifications.
You cannot meaningfully evaluate whether one number in the variable is larger than another number in the variable because higher numbers do not reflect higher levels of the concept.
Examples of nominal variables include:

- sex (e.g., 1 = male; 2 = female)
- race (e.g., 1 = American Indian; 2 = Asian; 3 = Black; 4 = Pacific Islander; 5 = White)
- ethnicity (e.g., 0 = Non-Hispanic/Latino; 1 = Hispanic/Latino)
- zip code
- jersey number

A football player's jersey number is an example of a nominal variable.
A jersey number of 7 is not higher on whatever concept of interest compared to a jersey number of 6.

To examine the central tendency of a nominal variable, you can determine the mode, but you cannot calculate a mean or median.

### Ordinal {#sec-ordinal}

A variable is considered ordinal if the classifications are ordered.
However, ordinal variables do not have equally spaced intervals.
Examples of ordinal intervals include:

- likert response scales (e.g., 1 = strongly disagree; 2 = disagree; 3 = neutral; 4 = agree; 5 = strongly agree)
- educational attainment (e.g., 1 = no formal education; 2 = elementary school; 3 = middle school; 4 = high school; 5 = college; 6 = graduate degree)
- academic grades on A–F scale (e.g., 1 = A; 2 = B; 3 = C; 4 = D; 5 = F)
- player rank (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd, etc.)

A football player's fantasy rank is an example of an ordinal variable.
A player with a fantasy rank of 1 has a higher rank than a player with a rank of 2, but it is not known how far apart each player is—i.e., the intervals do not all reflect the same distance.
For instance, the distance between the top-ranked player and the 2nd-best player might be 30 points, whereas the distance between the 2nd-best player and the 3rd-best player might be 2 points.

To examine the central tendency of ordinal data, the median and mode are most appropriate; however, the mean may be used (unlike for nominal data).

### Interval {#sec-interval}

A variable is considered interval if the classifications are ordered (similar to ordinal data) and have equally spaced intervals (unlike ordinal data).
However, interval variables do not have a meaningful zero that reflects absence.
Examples of interval data include:

- temperature on the Fahrenheit or Celsius scale
- time of day

For instance, the temperature difference between 80 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit is the same as the temperature difference between 90 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit.
However, 0 degrees Fahrenheit does not reflect absence of temperature/heat.

Interval data can be meaningfully added or subtracted.
For instance, if a game starts at 4 pm and ends at 7 pm, you know the game lasted 3 hours ($7 - 4 = 3$).
However, interval data cannot be meaningfully multiplied or divided.
For instance, 100 degrees Fahrenheit is not twice as hot as 50 degrees Fahrenheit.

To examine the central tendency of interval data, you can compute the mean, median, or mode.

### Ratio {#sec-ratio}

A variable is considered ratio if the classifications are ordered (similar to ordinal data), have equally spaced intervals (like interval data), and have an absolute zero point that reflects absence of the concept.
Examples of ratio data include:

- height
- weight
- age
- distance
- speed
- volume
- time elapsed
- income
- years of formal education
- points in football

For instance, points in football has order, equally spaced intervals, and an absolute zero—a team cannot score less than zero points, and zero points reflects absence of points (though it could be argued to be interval data because zero points does not reflect absence of skill.)

Ratio data can be meaningfully added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided.
A player who weighs 350 pounds weighs twice as much as someone who weighs 175 pounds.

To examine the central tendency of ratio data, you can compute the mean, median, or mode.
