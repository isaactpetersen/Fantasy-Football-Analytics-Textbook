# Getting Started with R for Data Analysis {#sec-gettingStarted}

The book uses `R` for statistical analyses (<http://www.r-project.org>).
R is a free software environment; you can download it at no charge here: <https://cran.r-project.org>.

## Initial Setup {#sec-initialSetup}

To get started, follow the following steps:

1. Install `R`: <https://cran.r-project.org>
1. Install `RStudio Desktop`: <https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop>
1. After installing `RStudio`, open `RStudio` and run the following code in the console to install several key `R` packages:

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages(c("petersenlab","tidyverse","psych"))
```

## Installing Packages {#sec-installingPackages}

You can install R packages using the following syntax:

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages("INSERT_PACKAGE_NAME_HERE")
```

For instance, you can use the following code to install the `nflreadr` package:

```{r}
#| eval: false

install.packages("nflreadr")
```

## Load Packages {#sec-loadPackages}

## Data Dictionary {#sec-dataDictionary}

Data Dictionaries are metadata that describe the meaning of the variables in a datset.
You can find Data Dictionaries for the various NFL datasets at the following link: <https://nflreadr.nflverse.com/articles/index.html>.

## Variable Names {#sec-variableNames}

To see the names of variables in a data frame, use the following syntax:

```{r}
names(nfl_players)
```

## Logical Operators {#sec-logicalOperators}

### Is Equal To: `==` {#sec-logicalOperatorEqual}

```{r}
#| eval: false

nfl_players$position_group == "RB"
```

### Is Not Equal To: `!=` {#sec-logicalOperatorNotEqual}

```{r}
#| eval: false

nfl_players$position_group != "RB"
```

### Is Greater Than: `>` {#sec-logicalOperatorGreaterThan}

```{r}
#| eval: false

nfl_players$weight > 300
```

### Is Less Than: `<` {#sec-logicalOperatorLessThan}

```{r}
#| eval: false

nfl_players$weight < 300
```

### Is Greater Than or Equal To: `>=` {#sec-logicalOperatorGreaterThanEqual}

```{r}
#| eval: false

nfl_players$weight >= 300
```

### Is Less Than or Equal To: `<=` {#sec-logicalOperatorLessThanEqual}

```{r}
#| eval: false

nfl_players$weight <= 300
```

### Is In a Value of Another Vector: `%in%` {#sec-logicalOperatorInVector}

```{r}
#| eval: false

nfl_players$position_group %in% c("QB","RB","WR")
```

### Is Not In a Value of Another Vector: `!(%in%)` {#sec-logicalOperatorNotInVector}

```{r}
#| eval: false

!(nfl_players$position_group %in% c("QB","RB","WR"))
```

### Is Missing: `is.na()` {#sec-logicalOperatorMissing}

```{r}
#| eval: false

is.na(nfl_players$college_name)
```

### Is Not Missing: `!is.na()` {#sec-logicalOperatorNotMissing}

```{r}
#| eval: false

!is.na(nfl_players$college_name)
```

### And: `&`{#sec-logicalOperatorAnd}

```{r}
#| eval: false

nfl_players$position_group == "RB" & nfl_players$weight > 230
```

### Or: `|` {#sec-logicalOperatorOr}

```{r}
#| eval: false

nfl_players$position_group == "RB" | nfl_players$weight > 230
```

## Subset {#sec-subset}

To subset a data frame, use brackets to specify the subset of rows and columns to keep, where the value/vector before the comma specifies the rows to keep, and the value/vector after the comma specifies the columns to keep:

```{r}
#| eval: false

dataframe[rowsToKeep, columnsToKeep]
```

You can subset by using any of the following:

- numeric indices of the rows/columns to keep (or drop)
- names of the rows/columns to keep (or drop)
- values of `TRUE` and `FALSE` corresponding to which rows/columns to keep

### One Variable {#sec-subsetOneVariable}

To subset one variable, use the following syntax:

```{r}
#| eval: false

nfl_players$display_name
```

or:

```{r}
nfl_players[,"display_name"]
```

### Particular Rows of One Variable {#sec-subsetParticularRowsOneVariable}

To subset one variable, use the following syntax:

```{r}
#| eval: false

nfl_players$display_name[which(nfl_players$position_group == "RB")]
```

or:

```{r}
nfl_players[which(nfl_players$position_group == "RB"), "display_name"]
```

### Particular Columns (Variables) {#sec-subsetParticularColumns}

To subset particular columns/variables, use the following syntax:

#### Base `R` {#sec-subsetParticularColumnsBaseR}

```{r}
subsetVars <- c("status","display_name","college_name")

nfl_players[,c(1,2,9)]
nfl_players[,c("status","display_name","college_name")]
nfl_players[,subsetVars]
```

Or, to drop columns:

```{r}
dropVars <- c("status","college_name")

nfl_players[,-c(1,9)]
nfl_players[,!(names(nfl_players) %in% c("status","college_name"))]
nfl_players[,!(names(nfl_players) %in% dropVars)]
```

#### Tidyverse {#sec-subsetParticularColumnsTidyverse}

```{r}
nfl_players %>%
  select(status, display_name, college_name)

nfl_players %>%
  select(status:college_name)

nfl_players %>%
  select(all_of(subsetVars))
```

Or, to drop columns:

```{r}
nfl_players %>%
  select(-status, -college_name)

nfl_players %>%
  select(-c(status:college_name))

nfl_players %>%
  select(-all_of(dropVars))
```

### Particular Rows {#sec-subsetParticularRows}

To subset particular rows, use the following syntax:

#### Base `R` {#sec-subsetParticularRowsBaseR}

```{r}
subsetRows <- c(1,3,5)

nfl_players[c(1,3,5),]
nfl_players[subsetRows,]
nfl_players[which(nfl_players$position_group == "RB"),]
```

#### Tidyverse {#sec-subsetParticularRowsTidyverse}

```{r}
nfl_players %>%
  filter(position_group == "RB")

nfl_players %>%
  filter(position_group == "RB", weight <= 250)

nfl_players %>%
  filter(position_group == "RB" | weight >= 250)
```

### Particular Rows and Columns {#sec-subsetParticularRowsAndColumns}

To subset particular rows and columns, use the following syntax:

#### Base `R` {#sec-subsetParticularRowsAndColumnsBaseR}

```{r}
nfl_players[c(1,3,5), c(1,2,3)]
nfl_players[subsetRows, subsetVars]
nfl_players[which(nfl_players$position_group == "RB"), subsetVars]
```

#### Tidyverse {#sec-subsetParticularRowsAndColumnsTidyverse}

```{r}
nfl_players %>%
  filter(position_group == "RB") %>%
  select(all_of(subsetVars))
```

## View Data {#sec-viewData}

### All Data {#sec-viewDataAll}

To view data, use the following syntax:

```{r}
#| eval: false

View(nfl_players)
```

### First 6 Rows/Elements {#sec-viewDataHead}

To view only the first six rows (if a data frame) or elements (if a vector), use the following syntax:

```{r}
head(nfl_players)
head(nfl_players$display_name)
```

## Data Characteristics {#sec-dataCharacteristics}

### Data Structure {#sec-dataCharacteristicsStructure}

```{r}
str(nfl_players)
```

### Data Dimensions {#sec-dataCharacteristicsDimensions}

Number of rows and columns:

```{r}
dim(nfl_players)
```

### Number of Elements {#sec-dataCharacteristicsLength}

```{r}
length(nfl_players$display_name)
```

### Number of Missing Elements {#sec-dataCharacteristicsMissingElements}

```{r}
length(nfl_players$college_name[which(is.na(nfl_players$college_name))])
```

### Number of Non-Missing Elements {#sec-dataCharacteristicsNonMissingElements}

```{r}
length(nfl_players$college_name[which(!is.na(nfl_players$college_name))])
length(na.omit(nfl_players$college_name))
```

## Create New Variables {#sec-createNewVars}

To create a new variable, use the following syntax:

```{r}
nfl_players$newVar <- NA
```

Here is an example of creating a new variable:

```{r}
nfl_players$newVar <- 1:nrow(nfl_players)
```

```{r}
#| include: false

nfl_players$newVar <- NULL
```

## Create a Data Frame {#sec-createDF}

Here is an example of creating a data frame:

```{r}
mydata <- data.frame(
  ID = c(1:5, 1047:1051),
  cat = sample(
    0:1,
    10,
    replace = TRUE)
)

mydata
```

## Recode Variables {#sec-recodeVars}

Here is an example of recoding a variable:

```{r}
mydata$oldVar1 <- NA
mydata$oldVar1[which(mydata$cat == 0)] <- "dog"
mydata$oldVar1[which(mydata$cat == 1)] <- "cat"

mydata$oldVar2 <- NA
mydata$oldVar2[which(mydata$cat == 0)] <- "no"
mydata$oldVar2[which(mydata$cat == 1)] <- "yes"
```

Recode multiple variables:

```{r}
mydata %>%
  mutate(across(c(
    oldVar1:oldVar2),
    ~ case_match(
      .,
      c("dog","no") ~ 0,
      c("cat","yes") ~ 1)))
```

## Rename Variables {#renameVars}

```{r}
mydata <- mydata %>% 
  rename(
    newVar1 = oldVar1,
    newVar2 = oldVar2)
```

Using a vector of variable names:

```{r}
#| eval: false

varNamesFrom <- c("oldVar1","oldVar2")
varNamesTo <- c("newVar1","newVar2")

mydata <- mydata %>% 
  rename_with(~ varNamesTo, all_of(varNamesFrom))
```

## Convert the Types of Variables {#convertVarTypes}

One variable:

```{r}
mydata$factorVar <- factor(mydata$ID)
mydata$numericVar <- as.numeric(mydata$cat)
mydata$integerVar <- as.integer(mydata$cat)
mydata$characterVar <- as.character(mydata$newVar1)
```

Multiple variables:

```{r}
mydata %>%
  mutate(across(c(
    ID,
    cat),
    as.numeric))

mydata %>%
  mutate(across(
    ID:cat,
    as.numeric))

mydata %>%
  mutate(across(where(is.factor), as.character))
```

## Merging/Joins {#sec-merging}

### Overview {#sec-mergingOverview}

Merging (also called joining) merges two data objects using a shared set of variables called "keys."
The keys are the variable(s) that uniquely identify each row (i.e., they account for the levels of nesting).
In some data objects, the key might be the participant's ID (e.g., `participantID`).
However, some data objects have multiple keys.
For instance, in long form data objects, each participant may have multiple rows corresponding to multiple timepoints.
In this case, the keys are `participantID` and `timepoint`.
If a participant has multiple rows corresponding to timepoints and measures, the keys are `participantID`, `timepoint`, and `measure`.
In general, each row should have a value on each of the keys; there should be no missingness in the keys.

To merge two objects, the keys must be present in both objects.
The keys are used to merge the variables in object 1 (`x`) with the variables in object 2 (`y`).
Different merge types select different rows to merge.

Note: if the two objects include variables with the same name (apart from the keys), `R` will not know how you want each to appear in the merged object.
So, it will add a suffix (e.g., `.x`, `.y`) to each common variable to indicate which object (i.e., object `x` or object `y`) the variable came from, where object `x` is the first object—i.e., the object to which object `y` (the second object) is merged.
In general, apart from the keys, you should not include variables with the same name in two objects to be merged.
To prevent this, either remove or rename the shared variable in one of the objects, or include the shared variable as a key.
However, as described above, you should include it as a key ***only*** if it uniquely identifies each row in terms of levels of nesting.

### Data Before Merging {#sec-mergingData}

Here are the data in the `nfl_actualStats_offense_weekly` object:

```{r}
nfl_actualStats_offense_weekly

dim(nfl_actualStats_offense_weekly)

dim(distinct(nfl_actualStats_offense_weekly, player_id, season, week, .keep_all = TRUE))

str(nfl_actualStats_offense_weekly[,c("player_id", "season", "week")])
```

The data are structured in player-season-week form.
That is, every row in the dataset is uniquely identified by the variables, `player_id`, `season`, and `week`.

Here are the data in the `nfl_expectedFantasyPoints_weekly` object:

```{r}
nfl_players

dim(nfl_players)

dim(distinct(nfl_players, gsis_id, .keep_all = TRUE))
```

### Types of Joins {#sec-mergeTypes}

#### Visual Overview of Join Types {#sec-mergeTypesVisual}

Below is a visual that depicts various types of merges/joins.
Object `x` is the circle labeled as `x`.
Object `y` is the circle labeled as `y`.
The area of overlap in the Venn diagram indicates the rows on the keys that are shared between the two objects (e.g., the same `player_id`, `season`, and `week`).
The non-overlapping area indicates the rows on the keys that are unique to each object.
The shaded blue area indicates which rows (on the keys) are kept in the merged object from each of the two objects, when using each of the merge types.
For instance, a left outer join keeps the shared rows and the rows that are unique to object `x`, but it drops the rows that are unique to object `y`.

![Types of merges/joins](images/joinTypes.png)

#### Full Outer Join {#sec-fullJoin}

A full outer join includes all rows in $x$ **or** $y$.
It returns columns from $x$ and $y$.
Here is how to merge two data frames using a full outer join (i.e., "full join"):

```{r}
fullJoinData <- full_join(
  nfl_actualStats_offense_weekly,
  nfl_players,
  by = c("player_id" = "gsis_id"))

fullJoinData
dim(fullJoinData)
```

#### Left Outer Join {#sec-leftJoin}

A left outer join includes all rows in $x$.
It returns columns from $x$ and $y$.
Here is how to merge two data frames using a left outer join ("left join"):

```{r}
leftJoinData <- left_join(
  nfl_actualStats_offense_weekly,
  nfl_players,
  by = c("player_id" = "gsis_id"))

leftJoinData
dim(leftJoinData)
```

#### Right Outer Join {#sec-rightJoin}

A right outer join includes all rows in $y$.
It returns columns from $x$ and $y$.
Here is how to merge two data frames using a right outer join ("right join"):

```{r}
rightJoinData <- right_join(
  nfl_actualStats_offense_weekly,
  nfl_players,
  by = c("player_id" = "gsis_id"))

rightJoinData
dim(rightJoinData)
```

#### Inner Join {#sec-innerJoin}

An inner join includes all rows that are in **both** $x$ **and** $y$.
An inner join will return one row of $x$ for each matching row of $y$, and can duplicate values of records on either side (left or right) if $x$ and $y$ have more than one matching record.
It returns columns from $x$ and $y$.
Here is how to merge two data frames using an inner join:

```{r}
innerJoinData <- inner_join(
  nfl_actualStats_offense_weekly,
  nfl_players,
  by = c("player_id" = "gsis_id"))

innerJoinData
dim(innerJoinData)
```

#### Semi Join {#sec-semiJoin}

A semi join is a filter.
A left semi join returns all rows from $x$ **with** a match in $y$.
That is, it filters out records from $x$ that are not in $y$.
Unlike an [inner join](#innerJoin), a left semi join will never duplicate rows of $x$, and it includes columns from only $x$ (not from $y$). 
Here is how to merge two data frames using a left semi join:

```{r}
semiJoinData <- semi_join(
  nfl_actualStats_offense_weekly,
  nfl_players,
  by = c("player_id" = "gsis_id"))

semiJoinData
dim(semiJoinData)
```

#### Anti Join {#sec-antiJoin}

An anti join is a filter.
A left anti join returns all rows from $x$ **without** a match in $y$.
That is, it filters out records from $x$ that are in $y$.
It returns columns from only $x$ (not from $y$).
Here is how to merge two data frames using a left anti join:

```{r}
antiJoinData <- anti_join(
  nfl_actualStats_offense_weekly,
  nfl_players,
  by = c("player_id" = "gsis_id"))

antiJoinData
dim(antiJoinData)
```

#### Cross Join {#sec-crossJoin}

A cross join combines each row in $x$ with each row in $y$.

```{r}
crossJoinData <- cross_join(
  unique(nfl_actualStats_offense_weekly[,c("player_id","player_display_name")]),
  data.frame(season = 2020:2024))

crossJoinData
dim(crossJoinData)
```

## Calculations {#sec-calculations}

### Historical Actual Player Statistics {#sec-calculateActualStats}

In addition to week-by-week actual player statistics, we can also compute historical actual player statistics as a function of different timeframes, including season-by-season and career statistics.

#### Career Statistics {#sec-calculateActualCareerStats}

First, we can compute the players' career statistics using the `calculate_player_stats()`, `calculate_player_stats_def()`, and `calculate_player_stats_kicking()` functions from the `nflfastR` package for offensive players, defensive players, and kickers, respectively.

::: {#nte-calculateActualCareerStats .callout-note title="Calculating players' career statistics"}
Note: the following code takes a while to run.
:::

```{r}
#| eval: false

nfl_actualStats_offense_career <- nflfastR::calculate_player_stats(
  nfl_pbp,
  weekly = FALSE)

nfl_actualStats_defense_career <- nflfastR::calculate_player_stats_def(
  nfl_pbp,
  weekly = FALSE)

nfl_actualStats_kicking_career <- nflfastR::calculate_player_stats_kicking(
  nfl_pbp,
  weekly = FALSE)
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: false

save(
  nfl_actualStats_offense_career, nfl_actualStats_defense_career, nfl_actualStats_kicking_career,
  file = here("data", "nfl_actualStats_career.RData")
)
```

```{r}
#| include: false

load(file = here("data", "nfl_actualStats_career.RData"))
```

#### Season-by-Season Statistics {#sec-calculateActualSeasonalStats}

Second, we can compute the players' season-by-season statistics.

```{r}
seasons <- unique(nfl_pbp$season)

nfl_pbp_seasonalList <- list()
nfl_actualStats_offense_seasonalList <- list()
nfl_actualStats_defense_seasonalList <- list()
nfl_actualStats_kicking_seasonalList <- list()
```

::: {#nte-calculateActualSeasonalStats .callout-note title="Calculating players' season-by-season statistics"}
Note: the following code takes a while to run.
:::

```{r}
#| eval: false

pb <- txtProgressBar(
  min = 0,
  max = length(seasons),
  style = 3)

for(i in 1:length(seasons)){
  # Subset play-by-play data by season
  nfl_pbp_seasonalList[[i]] <- nfl_pbp %>% 
    filter(season == seasons[i])
  
  # Compute actual statistics by season
  nfl_actualStats_offense_seasonalList[[i]] <- 
    nflfastR::calculate_player_stats(
      nfl_pbp_seasonalList[[i]],
      weekly = FALSE)

  nfl_actualStats_defense_seasonalList[[i]] <- 
    nflfastR::calculate_player_stats_def(
      nfl_pbp_seasonalList[[i]],
      weekly = FALSE)

  nfl_actualStats_kicking_seasonalList[[i]] <- 
    nflfastR::calculate_player_stats_kicking(
      nfl_pbp_seasonalList[[i]],
      weekly = FALSE)

  nfl_actualStats_offense_seasonalList[[i]]$season <- seasons[i]
  nfl_actualStats_defense_seasonalList[[i]]$season <- seasons[i]
  nfl_actualStats_kicking_seasonalList[[i]]$season <- seasons[i]
  
  print(
    paste("Completed computing projections for season: ", seasons[i], sep = ""))

  # Update the progress bar
  setTxtProgressBar(pb, i)
}

# Close the progress bar
close(pb)

nfl_actualStats_offense_seasonal <- nfl_actualStats_offense_seasonalList %>% 
  bind_rows()
nfl_actualStats_defense_seasonal <- nfl_actualStats_defense_seasonalList %>% 
  bind_rows()
nfl_actualStats_kicking_seasonal <- nfl_actualStats_kicking_seasonalList %>% 
  bind_rows()
```

```{r}
#| eval: false
#| include: false

save(
  nfl_actualStats_offense_seasonal, nfl_actualStats_defense_seasonal, nfl_actualStats_kicking_seasonal,
  file = here("data", "nfl_actualStats_seasonal.RData")
)
```

```{r}
#| include: false

load(file = here("data", "nfl_actualStats_seasonal.RData"))
```

#### Week-by-Week Statistics {#sec-calculateActualWeeklyStats}

We already load players' week-by-week statistics [above](#sec-downloadActualStats).
Nevertheless, we could compute players' weekly statistics from the play-by-play data using the following syntax:

```{r}
#| eval: false

nfl_actualStats_offense_weekly <- nflfastR::calculate_player_stats(
  nfl_pbp,
  weekly = TRUE)

nfl_actualStats_defense_weekly <- nflfastR::calculate_player_stats_def(
  nfl_pbp,
  weekly = TRUE)

nfl_actualStats_kicking_weekly <- nflfastR::calculate_player_stats_kicking(
  nfl_pbp,
  weekly = TRUE)
```
