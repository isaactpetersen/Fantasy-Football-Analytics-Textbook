# The Fantasy Draft {#sec-draft}

## Types of Fantasy Drafts {#sec-draftTypes}

There are several types of drafts in fantasy football.
The most common types of drafts are snake drafts and auction drafts.

### Snake Draft {#sec-draftSnake}

In a snake draft, the participants (i.e., managers) are assigned a draft order.
In the first round, the managers draft in that order.
In the second round, the managers draft in reverse order.
It continues to "snake" in this way, round after round, so that the person who has the first pick in a given round has the last pick in the next round, and whoever has the last pick in a given round has the first pick in the next round.

### Auction Draft {#sec-draftAuction}

In an auction draft, the managers are assigned a nomination order and there is a salary cap (e.g., $200).
The first manager chooses which player to nominate.
Then, the managers bid on that player like in an auction.
In order to bid, the manager must raise the price by at least $1.
If two managers want to obtain the same player, they may continue to raise the amount until one manager backs out and is no longer to bid by raising the price.
The highest bidder wins (i.e., drafts) that player.
Then, the second manager nominates a player, and the managers bid on that player.
This process repeats until all teams have drafted their allotment of players.

In the auction draft, unlike the snake draft, all players are available to all teams.
For instance, in the snake draft, the first 9 players drafted are unavailable to the 10th pick of the first round.
So, if you have the 10th pick and want the top-ranked player, this player would not be available to you in the snake draft.
However, in the auction draft, every player is available to every manager, so long as the manager is able and willing to bid enough.

## Draft Strategy {#sec-draftStrategy}

There is no one "right" draft strategy.
Sometimes it works best to "zig" when everyone else is "zagging".
For instance, if you notice that everyone else is drafting Wide Receivers, this may mean that other managers are over-valuing Wide Receivers, and this could be a nice opportunity to draft a Running Back for good value.

In general, you will first want to generate the rankings you will use to select which players to prioritize.
You may generate your rankings based one or more of the following:

- your [evaluation of players](player-evaluation.qmd)
- expert or aggregated rankings
- players' Average Draft Position (ADP) in other league drafts (for snake drafts), or players' Average Auction Value (AAV) in other league drafts (for auction drafts)
- expert or aggregated projections

An important concept in the draft is "dropoff", which is described in Section @sec-fantasyValue.
*Dropoff* at a given position, is the difference—in terms of projected fantasy points—between (a) the best available player remaining at that position and (b) the second-best available player remaining at that position.
If there is a bigger dropoff at a given position, there may be greater value in drafting the top player from that position.
For instance, consider the following scenario:
"Quarterback A" is projected to score 325 points, and "Quarterback B" is projected to score 320 points.
"Tight End A" is projected to score 230 points, and "Tight End B" is projected to score 150 points.
In this example, there is a much greater dropoff for Tight Ends than there is for Quarterbacks.
Thus, even though "Quarterback A" is projected to score more points than "Tight End A", "Tight End A" may be more valuable because there is still a good Quarterback available if someone else drafts "Quarterback A".

### Snake Draft {#sec-draftStrategySnake}

An important concept in the snake draft is a player's value over a typical replacement player at that position (shortened to "value over replacement player"), which is described in Section @sec-fantasyValue.
A player's *value over a replacement player* (VORP) is the difference between (a) a player's projected fantasy points and (b) the fantasy points that you would be expected to get from a typical bench player at that position.
