## Overview {#sec-baseRatesConclusion}

The *base rate* is a marginal probability, which is the general probability of an event irrespective of other things.
For instance, the base rate of HIV is the probability of developing HIV.
In the U.S., [the prevalence rate of HIV is ~0.4% of the adult population](https://map.aidsvu.org/profiles/nation/usa/overview) (archived at <https://perma.cc/8GE6-GAPC>).
