This book is about empiricism (basing theories on observed data) and judgment, prediction, and decision making in the context of uncertainty. The book provides an introduction to modern analytical techniques used to make informed predictions, test theories, and draw conclusions from a given dataset.\nThis book was originally written for a undergraduate-level course entitled, “Fantasy Football: Predictive Analytics and Empiricism”. The chapters provide an overview of topics that each could have its own class and textbook, such as causal inference, factor analysis, cluster analysis, principal component analysis, machine learning, cognitive biases, modern portfolio theory, data visualization, simulation, etc. The book gives readers an overview of the breadth of the approaches to prediction and empiricism. As a consequence, the book does not cover any one technique or approach in great depth.",

    "text": "1.3 Why Focus on Fantasy Football?\nI was fortunate to have an excellent instructor who taught me the value of learning statistics to answer interesting and important questions. That is, I do not find statistics intrinsically interesting; rather, I find them interesting because of what they allow me to do. Many students find statistics intimidating in part because of how it is typically taught—with examples like dice rolls and coin flips that are (seemingly irrelevant and) boring to students. My contention is that applied examples are a more effective lens to teach many concepts in psychology and data analysis. It can be more engaging and relatable to learn statistics in the applied context of sports, a domain that is more intuitive to many. Many people play fantasy sports. This book involves applying statistics to a particular domain (football). People actually want to learn statistical principles and methods when they can apply them to interesting questions (e.g., sports). In my opinion [and supported by evidence; Motz (2013)], this is a much more effective way of engaging people and teaching statistics than in the context of abstract coin flips and dice rolls. Fantasy football relies heavily on prediction—trying to predict which players will perform best and selecting them accordingly. In this way, fantasy football provides a plethora of decision making opportunities in the face of uncertainty, and a wealth of data for analyzing these decisions. However, unlike many other applied domains in psychology, fantasy football (1) allows a person to see the accuracy of their predictions on a timely basis and (2) provides a safe environment for friendly competition. Thus, it provides a unique domain to evaluate—and improve—the accuracy of various prediction models.",

    "text": "1.4 Educational Value\nSkills in statistics, statistical programming, and data analysis are highly valuable. This book includes practical and conceptual tools that build a foundation for critical thinking. The book aims to help readers evaluate theory in the light of evidence (and vice versa) and to refine decision making in the context of uncertainty. Readers will learn about the ways that psychological science (and related disciplines) poses questions, formulates hypotheses, designs studies to test those questions, and interprets the findings, collectively with the aim to answer questions, improve decision making, and solve problems.\nOf course, this is not a traditional psychology textbook. However, the book incorporates important psychological concepts, such as cognitive biases in judgment and prediction, etc. In the modern world of big data, research and society need people who know how to make sense of the information around us. Psychology is in a prime position to teach applied statistics to a wide variety of students, most of whom will not have careers as psychologists. Psychology can teach the importance of statistics given humans’ cognitive biases. It can also teach about how these biases can influence how people interpret statistics. This book will teach readers the applications of statistics (prediction) and research methods (empiricism) to answer questions they find interesting, while applying scientific and psychological rigor.",

    "text": "2.1.1 The Objective\nThe goal in football is for a team to score more points than their opponent. A game lasts 60 minutes, and it is separated into four 15-minute quarters. The team with the most points when the time runs out wins.\nHere is a video that provides a brief introduction to American football:\n\n\nVideo\nVideo that Provides An Introduction to American Football.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 The Roster\n\n2.1.2.1 Overview\nEach team has 11 players on the field at a time. The particular players who are on the field will depend on the situation, but usually includes one of the three subsets of players:\n\nOffense\nDefense\nSpecial Teams\n\nAn example formation is depicted in Figure Figure 2.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: An Example Football Formation for the Offense and Defense. The solid line indicates the line of scrimmage. The arrow indicates the direction the offense tries to advance the ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2.2 Offense\nThe offense is on the field when the team has the ball.\nPlayers on offense include:\n\nQuarterback (QB)\nRunning Back (RB)\n\nHalfback (HB) or Tailback (TB)\nFullback (FB)\n\nWide Receiver (WR)\nTight End (TE)\nOffensive Linemen (OL), part of the “Offensive Line”\n\nCenter (C)\nOffensive Guard (OG)\nOffensive Tackle (OT)\n\n\nThe quarterback is the most important player on the offense. They help lead the team down the field. The quarterback receives the ball from the Center at the beginning of the play, and they can either hand the ball off (typically to a Running Back or Fullback), pass the ball (typically to a Wide Receiver or Tight End), or run the ball. Quarterbacks tend to have a strong arm for throwing the ball far and accurately. Some quarterbacks are fast and are considered “dual threats” to pass or run.\nRunning Backs take a hand-off from the Quarterback to execute a running play (i.e., a rush). They may also catch short passes from the Quarterback or help protect (i.e., block for) the Quarterback from the defensive players who are trying to tackle the Quarterback. Halfbacks and Tailbacks tend to be quick and agile. Fullbacks tend to be strong and powerful.\nWide Receivers catch passes from the Quarterback to execute a passing play. On running plays, they provide protection for the player running the ball (e.g., the Running Back) so the ball carrier can get as far as possible without being tackled. Wide receivers tend to be tall, fast, have good hands (can catch the ball well), and can jump high.\nTight Ends block for running and passing plays, and they catch passes from the Quarterback. Tight ends tend to be strong and have good hands.\nOffensive Linemen block for running and passing plays. On passing plays, they provide protection for the Quarterback so the Quarterback has time to pass the ball without being tackled. On running plays, they provide protection for the player running the ball (e.g., the Running Back) so the ball carrier can get as far as possible without being tackled. Offensive Linemen tend to be large so they can provide adequate protection for the Quarterback and Running Back.\n\n\n2.1.2.3 Defense\nThe defense is on the field when the team does not have the ball (i.e., when the opposing team has the ball).\nPlayers on defense include:\n\nDefensive Linemen (DL), part of the “Defensive Line”\n\nDefensive End (DE)\nDefensive Tackle (DT)\n\nLinebacker (LB)\n\nMiddle (or Inside) Linebacker (MLB)\nOutside Linebacker (OLB)\n\nDefensive Back (DB), part of the “Secondary”\n\nCornerback (CB)\nSafety (S)\n\nFree Safety (FS)\nStrong Safety (SS)\n\n\n\nThe players on the defense attempt to tackle the offensive players for as short of gains as possible and attempt to prevent completed passes.\nOn passing plays, Defensive Linemen try to apply pressure to the Quarterback and try to tackle the Quarterback behind the line of scrimmage before the Quarterback can throw the ball (i.e., a sack). On rushing plays, Defensive Linemen try to tackle the ball carrier to prevent the ball carrier from advancing the ball (i.e., gaining yards). Defensive Linemen tend to be large yet quick so they can apply pressure to the Quarterback.\nLinebackers are versatile in that, on a given play, they may attempt to a) “blitz” to sack the Quarterback, b) stop the Running Back, or c) prevent a completed pass. Linebackers tend to be strong yet agile.\nDefensive Backs are specialist pass defenders. The main role of Cornerbacks is to cover the Wide Receivers. Safeties serve as the last line of defense for longer passes. Defensive Backs tend to be quick and agile.\n\n\n2.1.2.4 Special Teams\nThe special teams involves specialist players who are on the field during all kicking plays including kickoffs, field goals, and punts.\nPlayers on special teams include:\n\nKicker (K)\nPunter (P)\nHolder\nLong Snapper\nPunt Returner\nKick Returner\nand other players intended to block for or to tackle the ball carrier\n\nOn a field goal attempt, the Long Snapper snaps the ball to the Holder, who holds the ball for the Kicker. The Kicker attempts field goals and, during kickoffs, kicks the ball to the opposing team. During kickoffs, the Kick Returner catches the kicked ball and returns it for as many yards as possible. During a punt play, the Long Snapper snaps the ball to the Punter who kicks (i.e., punts) the ball to the opposing team. The Punt Returner catches the punted ball and returns it for as many yards as possible.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 The Field\nThe football field is rectangular and is 120 yards long and 53 1/3 yards wide (109.73 m x 48.77 m).2 At each end of the 120-yard field is a team’s end zone. Each end zone is 10 yards long (9.14 m). Thus, the distance from one end zone to the other end zone is 100 yards (91.44 m). Behind each end zone is a field goal post. A diagram of a football field is depicted in Figure Figure 2.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: A Diagram of a Football Field. The yard markers depict the distance from the nearest end zone. The orange shaded area is called the “red zone”, where chances of scoring points are highest. The original figure was modified to depict field goal posts. (Figure retrieved from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:American_football_field.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 The Gameplay\nAt the beginning of the game, there is a coin flip to determine which teams receives the ball first and which team takes which side of the field. During the kickoff, the kicking team kicks the ball to the receiving team, who has the option to return the kick. The offense starts their possession at the 25 yard line—if there is no return (i.e., a touchback)—or wherever the kick returner is tackled or goes out of bounds.\nThe team with the ball (i.e., the offense) has four opportunities (“downs”) to advance the ball (i.e., gain) 10 yards. A team can advance the ball either by running it or by throwing (i.e., passing) and catching it. At the end of a rushing play, the ball advances to wherever the ball carrier is tackled or goes out of bounds (i.e., wherever the player is “down”). At the end of a passing play, if the thrown ball is caught (i.e., a completed pass), the ball advances to wherever the ball carrier is tackled or goes out of bounds. If the thrown ball is not caught in bounds before the ball hits the ground (i.e., an incomplete pass), the ball does not advance. Wherever the ball is advanced to dictates where the next play begins. The yard position on the field where the next play takes place from is known as the “line of scrimmage”. Neither team can cross the line the line of scrimmage until the next play begins. To begin the play, the ball is placed on the line of scrimmage and the Center gives (or “snaps”) the ball to the Quarterback.\nIf the team advances the ball 10 or more yards within four downs, the team receives a “first down” and is awarded a new set of downs—four more downs to advance the ball 10 more yards. If the team advances the ball all the way to the other team’s end zone, they score a touchdown. If the team fails to advance the ball 10 or more yards within four downs, the team loses the ball, and the other team takes possession at that spot on the field. There are risks of giving the other team the ball with a short distance to score. Thus, on fourth down, instead of trying to advance the ball for a first down, a team may choose to kick a field goal—to get points—or to punt.\nA field goal involves a kicker kicking the ball with an intent to kick the ball through the field goal posts (“uprights”). To score points by making a field goal, the kicked ball must go between the uprights (extended vertically) and over the cross bar.\nPunting involves a punter kicking the ball to the other team with an intent to give their opponent worse field position, thus making it harder for the other team to score. The punting team tries to pin the opponent as close as possible to the opponent’s end zone (i.e., as far as possible from the own team’s end zone), so they have a longer distance to go to score a touchdown.\nThere are multiple ways that ball possession can switch from the offense to the other team. After scoring a touchdown, field goal, or safety, there is a kickoff, in which the scoring team kicks the ball to the opponent. Another way that the ball switches possession to the other team is if the team commits a turnover. The defense can force a turnover by an interception, fumble recovery, or turnover on downs. A turnover due to an interception occurs when a defensive player catches the quarterback’s pass. A turnover due to a fumble recovery occurs when an offensive player, who had possession of the ball, loses the ball before being down or scoring a touchdown and the ball is recovered by the opponent. A turnover on downs occurs when the team attempts on fourth down to achieve the remainder of the needed 10 yards to go but fails.\nOther football-related situations include tackles for loss and sacks. A tackle for loss occurs when a ball carrier is tackled behind the line of scrimmage. A sack occurs when a Quarterback is tackled with the ball behind the line of scrimmage. A pass defended occurs when a defensive player knocks down the ball in the air so that the indended receiver cannot catch the ball.\n\n\n2.1.5 The Scoring\nThe goal of the team with the ball (i.e., the offense) is to score points. It can do this by either advancing the ball into the other team’s end zone (6 points) or by kicking a field goal (3 points). Advancing the ball in the other team’s end zone is called a touchdown. After a touchdown, the offense chooses to attempt either a point-after-touchdown (PAT) or a two-point conversion. A PAT is a short kick attempt from the 15-yard line (i.e., 15 yards away from the end zone) that, if it goes through the goal posts (“uprights”) and over the cross bar, is worth 1 point. A two-point conversion is a single-scoring opportunity from the 3-yard line (i.e., 3 yards away from the end zone). If the offense scores (i.e., advances the ball into the end zone) from the 3-yard line, the team is awarded 2 points.\nA team can kick a field goal from any distance as long as the kick goes through the goal posts. The current record for the longest field goal is 66 yards (by Justin Tucker in 2021).\nA safety occurs when the offense is tackled with the ball in their own end zone. When a safety occurs, the opposing team (i.e., defense) is awarded two points and the ball.\n\n\n2.1.6 Glossary of Terms\n\nrunning play (“run”) or rushing play (or “rush”)—the attempt by an offensive player, typically the Running Back or Quarterback, to advance the ball “on the ground” by running it—not by passing it forward\npassing play (or “pass”)—the attempt by an offensive player, typically the Quarterback, to advance the ball by throwing it forward to an offensive player\npassing attempt—the attempt to advance the ball by passing it (i.e., a thrown pass)\nrushing attempt—the attempt to advance the ball by running it\npassing completion—a thrown pass that is succesfully caught by an offensive player\npassing incompletion—a thrown pass that is not caught by an offensive player\npassing yards—the distance (in yards) the player advanced the ball by throwing it\nrushing yards—the distance (in yards) the player advanced the ball by running it\nreceving yards—the distance (in yards) the player advanced the ball by catching thrown passes and then running with it further upfield\nkick/punt return yards—the distance (in yards) the player advanced the ball by returning kicks or punts\nturnover return yards—the distance (in yards) the player advanced the ball by returning turnovers\nreception—a pass that is caught by the offensive player\ntouchdown—advancing the ball into the opponent’s end zone either by a) throwing a completed pass that ends up in the end zone, b) running it into the end zone, c) catching it in the end zone, or d) catching it and then running it into the end zone\npassing touchdown—advancing the ball into the opponent’s end zone either by throwing a completed pass that ends up in the end zone\nrushing touchdown—advancing the ball into the opponent’s end zone either by running it into the end zone\nreceiving touchdown—advancing the ball into the opponent’s end zone either by catching it in the end zone or by catching it and then running it into the end zone\nkick/punt return touchdown—advancing the ball into the opponent’s end zone when returning a kick or punt\nturnover return touchdown—advancing the ball into the opponent’s end zone when returning a turnover (i.e., interception or fumble)\ntwo-point conversion—a single-scoring opportunity from the 3-yard line (i.e., 3 yards away from the end zone) that is an option given to a team that scores a touchdown; if the offense scores (i.e., advances the ball into the end zone) from the 3-yard line, the team is awarded 2 points\nblock—when the defense/special teams blocks a kick or field goal by hitting the ball just after it is kicked to prevent the ball from going far\nkickoff—the kicking team kicks the ball to the receiving team, who has the option to return the kick\nfield goal—a kicker kicks the ball with an intent to kick the ball through the field goal posts (“uprights”).

Managers make decisions such as selecting which players to draft, selecting which players to play (i.e., “start”) on a weekly basis, identifying players to pick up from the remaining pool of available players (i.e., waiver wire), and making trades with other teams. Fantasy football relies heavily on prediction—trying to predict which players will perform best and selecting them accordingly.\nHere is a video that provides a brief introduction to fantasy football:\n\n\nVideo\nVideo that Provides an Introduction to Fantasy Football.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 The Fantasy League\nA fantasy football “league” is composed of various imaginary (i.e., “fantasy”) teams—and their associated manager. In the fantasy league, the managers’ fantasy teams play against each other. A fantasy league is commonly composed of 8, 10, or 12 fantasy teams, but leagues can have more or fewer teams.\n\n\n2.2.3 The Roster of a Fantasy Team\nOn a given roster, a manager has a “starting lineup” and a “bench”. Each week, the manager decides which players on their roster to put in the starting lineup, and which to keep on the bench. In many leagues, a starting lineup is composed of offensive players, a kicker, and defense/special teams:\nOffensive players:\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Offensive Players in the Starting Lineup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition\nTypical Number of Players in Starting Lineup\n\n\n\n\nQuarterback (QB)\n1\n\n\nRunning Back (RB)\n2\n\n\nWide Receiver (WR)\n2\n\n\nTight End (TE)\n1\n\n\nFlex Position\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA “flex position” is a flexible position that can involve a player from various positions: e.g., a Running Back, Wide Receiver, or Tight End.\nKickers:\n\none Kicker (K)\n\nDefense/Special Teams:\n\none Team Defense (DST/D/DEF) or multiple Individual Defensive Players (IDP)\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Scoring\n\n2.2.4.1 Scoring Overview\nIn the game of fantasy football, managers accumulate points on a weekly basis based on players’ actual statistical performances in NFL games. Managers receive points for only those players who are on their starting lineup (not players on their bench). A manager’s goal is to outscore their opponent each week to win matches and ultimately claim victory in the league. Scoring settings can differ from league to league.\nBelow are common scoring settings for fantasy leagues.\n\n\n2.2.4.2 Offensive Players\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Common Scoring Settings for Offensive Players\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical category\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nRushing or receiving TD\n6\n\n\nReturning a kick or punt for a TD\n6\n\n\nReturning or recovering a fumble for a TD\n6\n\n\nPassing TD\n4\n\n\nPassing INT\n−2\n\n\nFumble lost\n−2\n\n\nRushing, passing, or receiving 2-point conversion\n2\n\n\nRushing or receiving yards\n1 point per 10 yards\n\n\nPassing yards\n1 point per 25 yards\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: “TD” = touchdown; “INT” = interception\nOther common (but not necessarily standard) statistical categories include:\n\nreceptions (called “point per reception” [PPR] leagues)\nreturn yards\npassing attempts\nrushing attempts\n\n\n\n2.2.4.3 Kickers\n\n\n\nTable 2.3: Common Scoring Settings for Kickers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical category\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nFG made: 50+ yards\n5\n\n\nFG made: 40–49 yards\n4\n\n\nFG made: 39 yards or less\n3\n\n\nRushing, passing, or receiving 2-point conversion\n2\n\n\nPoint after touchdown attempt made\n1\n\n\nPoint after touchdown attempt missed\n−1\n\n\nMissed FG: 0–39 yards\n−2\n\n\nMissed FG: 40–49 yards\n−1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: “FG” = field goal\n\n\n2.2.4.4 Team Defense/Special Teams\n\n\n\nTable 2.4: Common Scoring Settings for Team Defense/Special Teams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical category\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nDefensive or special teams TD\n3\n\n\nInterception\n2\n\n\nFumble recovery\n2\n\n\nBlocked punt, PAT, or FG\n2\n\n\nSafety\n2\n\n\nSack\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: “TD” = touchdown; “PAT” = point after touchdown; “FG” = field goal\n\n\n2.2.4.5 Individual Defensive Players\n\n\n\nTable 2.5: Common Scoring Settings for Individual Defensive Players\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical category\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nTackle solo\n1\n\n\nTackle assist\n0.5\n\n\nTackle for loss\n1\n\n\nSack\n2\n\n\nInterception\n4\n\n\nFumble forced\n2\n\n\nFumble recovery\n2\n\n\nTD\n6\n\n\nSafety\n2\n\n\nPass defended\n1\n\n\nBlocked kick\n2\n\n\nExtra point returned\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: “TD” = touchdown\nOther common (but not necessarily standard) statistical categories include:\n\nturnover return yards\n\n\n\n2.2.4.6 Common Scoring Abbreviations\n\n“TD” = touchdown\n“INT” = interception\n“yds” = yards\n“ATT” = attempts\n“2-pt conversion” = two-point conversion\n“FG” = field goal\n“PAT” = point after touchdown (i.e., extra point/point after attempt)",

    "text": "3.16 Merging/Joins\n\n3.16.1 Overview\nMerging (also called joining) merges two data objects using a shared set of variables called “keys.” The keys are the variable(s) that uniquely identify each row (i.e., they account for the levels of nesting). In some data objects, the key might be the player’s identification number (e.g., player_id). However, some data objects have multiple keys. For instance, in long form data objects, each participant may have multiple rows corresponding to multiple seasons. In this case, the keys may be player_id and season. If a participant has multiple rows corresponding to seasons and games/weeks, the keys are player_id, season, and week. In general, each row should have a value on each of the keys; there should be no missingness in the keys.\nTo merge two objects, the key(s) that will be used to match the records must be present in both objects. The keys are used to merge the variables in object 1 (x) with the variables in object 2 (y). Different merge types select different rows to merge.\nNote: if the two objects include variables with the same name (apart from the keys), R will not know how you want each to appear in the merged object. So, it will add a suffix (e.g., .x, .y) to each common variable to indicate which object (i.e., object x or object y) the variable came from, where object x is the first object—i.e., the object to which object y (the second object) is merged. In general, apart from the keys, you should not include variables with the same name in two objects to be merged. To prevent this, either remove or rename the shared variable in one of the objects, or include the shared variable as a key. However, as described above, you should include it as a key only if it uniquely identifies each row in terms of levels of nesting.\n\n\n3.16.2 Data Before Merging\nHere are the data in the players object:\n\n\nCode\nplayers\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCode\ndim(players)\n\n\n[1] 12 10\n\n\nThe data are structured in ID form. That is, every row in the dataset is uniquely identified by the variable, ID.\nHere are the data in the fantasyPoints object:\n\n\nCode\nfantasyPoints\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCode\ndim(fantasyPoints)\n\n\n[1] 4 2\n\n\n\n\n3.16.3 Types of Joins\n\n3.16.3.1 Visual Overview of Join Types\nBelow is a visual that depicts various types of merges/joins. Object x is the circle labeled as x. Object y is the circle labeled as y. The area of overlap in the Venn diagram indicates the rows on the keys that are shared between the two objects (e.g., the same player_id, season, and week). The non-overlapping area indicates the rows on the keys that are unique to each object. The shaded blue area indicates which rows (on the keys) are kept in the merged object from each of the two objects, when using each of the merge types. For instance, a left outer join keeps the shared rows and the rows that are unique to object x, but it drops the rows that are unique to object y.\n\n\n\nTypes of merges/joins\n\n\n\n\n3.16.3.2 Full Outer Join\nA full outer join includes all rows in \\(x\\) or \\(y\\). It returns columns from \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Here is how to merge two data frames using a full outer join (i.e., “full join”):\n\n\nCode\nfullJoinData &lt;- full_join(\n  players,\n  fantasyPoints,\n  by = \"ID\")\n\nfullJoinData\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCode\ndim(fullJoinData)\n\n\n[1] 14 11\n\n\n\n\n3.16.3.3 Left Outer Join\nA left outer join includes all rows in \\(x\\). It returns columns from \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Here is how to merge two data frames using a left outer join (“left join”):\n\n\nCode\nleftJoinData &lt;- left_join(\n  players,\n  fantasyPoints,\n  by = \"ID\")\n\nleftJoinData\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCode\ndim(leftJoinData)\n\n\n[1] 12 11\n\n\n\n\n3.16.3.4 Right Outer Join\nA right outer join includes all rows in \\(y\\). It returns columns from \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Here is how to merge two data frames using a right outer join (“right join”):\n\n\nCode\nrightJoinData &lt;- right_join(\n  players,\n  fantasyPoints,\n  by = \"ID\")\n\nrightJoinData\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCode\ndim(rightJoinData)\n\n\n[1]  4 11\n\n\n\n\n3.16.3.5 Inner Join\nAn inner join includes all rows that are in both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). An inner join will return one row of \\(x\\) for each matching row of \\(y\\), and can duplicate values of records on either side (left or right) if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have more than one matching record. It returns columns from \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Here is how to merge two data frames using an inner join:\n\n\nCode\ninnerJoinData &lt;- inner_join(\n  players,\n  fantasyPoints,\n  by = \"ID\")\n\ninnerJoinData\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCode\ndim(innerJoinData)\n\n\n[1]  2 11\n\n\n\n\n3.16.3.6 Semi Join\nA semi join is a filter. A left semi join returns all rows from \\(x\\) with a match in \\(y\\). That is, it filters out records from \\(x\\) that are not in \\(y\\). Unlike an inner join, a left semi join will never duplicate rows of \\(x\\), and it includes columns from only \\(x\\) (not from \\(y\\)). Here is how to merge two data frames using a left semi join:\n\n\nCode\nsemiJoinData &lt;- semi_join(\n  players,\n  fantasyPoints,\n  by = \"ID\")\n\nsemiJoinData\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCode\ndim(semiJoinData)\n\n\n[1]  2 10\n\n\n\n\n3.16.3.7 Anti Join\nAn anti join is a filter. A left anti join returns all rows from \\(x\\) without a match in \\(y\\). That is, it filters out records from \\(x\\) that are in \\(y\\). It returns columns from only \\(x\\) (not from \\(y\\)). Here is how to merge two data frames using a left anti join:\n\n\nCode\nantiJoinData &lt;- anti_join(\n  players,\n  fantasyPoints,\n  by = \"ID\")\n\nantiJoinData\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCode\ndim(antiJoinData)\n\n\n[1] 10 10\n\n\n\n\n3.16.3.8 Cross Join\nA cross join combines each row in \\(x\\) with each row in \\(y\\).\n\n\nCode\ncrossJoinData &lt;- cross_join(\n  players,\n  fantasyPoints)\n\ncrossJoinData\n\n\n\n  \n\n\n\nCode\ndim(crossJoinData)\n\n\n[1] 48 12",

Greater weight is particularly valuable for Linemen, Fullbacks, and Tight Ends, but it can also be valuable—to a deree—for Quarterbacks, Running Backs, and Wide Receivers.

However, the extent to which historical performance may predict future performance may depend on many factors such as (a) the similarity of the prior situation to the current situation, (b) how long ago the prior situation was, and (c) the extent to which the player (or situation) has changed in the interim. For rookies, the player does not have prior seasons of performance in the NFL to draw upon. Thus, when evaluating rookies, it can be helpful to consider their performance in college or in their prior leagues. However, there are large differences between the situation in college and the situation in the NFL, so prior success in college may not portend future success in the NFL. An indicator that intends to be prognostic of future performance, and that accounts for past performance, is a player’s draft position—that is, how early (or late) was a player selected in the NFL Draft. The earlier a player was selected in the NFL Draft, the greater likelihood that the player will perform well.\nFor players who have played in the NFL, past performance becomes more relevant because, presumably, the prior situation is more similar (than was their situation in college) to their current situation. Nevertheless, lots of things change from game to game and season to season: injuries, coaches, coaching strategies, teammates, etc. So just because a player performed well or poorly in a given game or season does not necessarily mean that they will perform similarly in subsequent games/seasons. Nevertheless, historical performance is one of the best indicators we have.\nWe demonstrate how to import historical player statistics in Section Section 3.4.12. We demonstrate how to calculate historical player statistics in Section Section 3.19.1. We demonstrate how to calculate historical fantasy points in Section Section 3.19.2.\nIn addition to how many fantasy points a player scores in terms of historical performance, we also care about efficiency and consistency. How efficient were they given the number of opportunities they had? If they were relatively more efficient, they will likely score more points than many of their peers when given more opportunities. If they were relativelly inefficient, their capacity to score fantasy points may be more dependent on touches/opportunities. Efficiency might be operationalized by indicators such as yards per passing attempt, yards per rushing attempt, yards per target, yards per reception, etc.\nIn terms of consistency, how consistent was the player they from game to game and from season to season? For instance, we could examine the standard deviations of players’ fantasy points across games in a given season. However, the standard deviation tends to be upwardly biased as the mean increases. So, we can account for the player’s mean fantasy points per game by dividing their game-to-game standard deviation of fantasy points by their mean fantasy points across games. This is known as the coefficient of variation (CV):\n\\[\nCV = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}\n\\]\nPlayers with a lower standard deviation and a lower coefficient of variation (of fantasy points across games) are more consistent.\n[ADD EXAMPLE]",

A player is embedded within a broader team context; it is important to consider the strength of their team context insofar as it may support— or detract from—a player’s performance. For instance, for a Quarterback, it is important to consider how strong the pass blocking is from the Offensive Line. Will they have enough time to throw the ball, or will they be constantly under pressure to be sacked? It is also important to consider the strength of the pass catchers—the Wide Receivers and Tight Ends. For a Running Back, it is important to consider how strong the run blocking is from the Offensive Line. For a Wide Receiver, it is important to consider how strong the pass blocking is, and how strong the Quarterback is.\nIt is also important to consider a player’s role on the team. Is the player a starter or a backup? Related to this, it is important to consider the strength of one’s teammates. For a given Running Back, if a teammate is better at running the ball, this may take away from how much the player sees the field. For a given Wide Receiver, if a teammate is better at catching the ball, this may take some targets away from the player. However, the team’s top defensive back is often matched up against the team’s top Wide Receiver. So, if the team’s top Wide Receiver is matched up against a particularly strong Defensive Back, the second- and third-best Wide Receivers may more targets than usual.\nIt is also important to consider a player’s opportunity and usage, which are influenced by many factors, including the skill of the player, the skill of their teammates, the role of the player on the team, the coaching style, the strategy of the opposing team, game scripts, etc. In terms of the player’s opportunity and usage, how many snaps do they get? How many touches and/or targets do they receive? Being on the field for more snaps and receiving more touches and/or targets means that the player has more opportunities to score fantasy points. Are they targeted in the red zone? Red zone targets are more likely to lead to touchdown scoring opportunities, which are particularly valuable in fantasy football.",

For instance, a contract may have a performance incentive that provides a player greater compensation if they achieve a particular performance milestone (e.g., receiving yards). Another potential incentive is if a player is in what is called their “contract year” (i.e., the last year of their current contract). If a player is in the last year of their current contract, they have an incentive to perform well so they can get re-signed to a new contract.",

For instance, [DESCRIBE] Thus, if using rankings, ADP, or AAV, it is important to find ones from leagues that mirror—as closely as possible—your league settings.\nProjected statistics (e.g., projected passing touchdowns) are agnostic to league settings and can thus be used to generate league-specific fantasy projections and rankings. Thus, projected statisitics may be more useful than rankings because they can be used to generate rankings for your particular league settings. For instance, if you know how many touchdowns, yards, and interceptions a Quarterback is a projected to throw (in addition to any other relevant categories for the player, e.g., rushing yards and touchdowns), you can calculate how many fantasy points the Quarterback is expected to gain in your league (or in any league). Thus, you can calculate ranking from projections, but you cannot reverse engineer projections from rankings.\nThere are many potential indices that can be worthwhile to consider, including a player’s:\n\ndropoff\nvalue over replacement player (VORP)\nuncertainty\n\nA player’s dropoff, is the difference between (a) the player’s projected points and (b) the projected points of the next-best player at that position. We can also consider a player’s value over a typical replacement player at that position (shortened to “value over replacement player”). A player’s value over a replacement player (VORP) is the difference between (a) a player’s projected fantasy points and (b) the fantasy points that you would be expected to get from a typical bench player at that position.\nA player’s uncertainty is how much variability there is in projections or rankings for a given player across sources. For instance, consider a scenario where three experts provide ratings about two players, Player A and Player B. Player A is projected to score 300, 310, and 290 points by experts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Player B is projected to score 400, 300, and 200 points by experts 1, 2, and 3, respectively.

Younger, less experienced players may show a higher upside but a lower downside.\nThe extent to which you prioritize a higher upside versus a higher downside may depend on many factors. For instance, when drafting players, you may prioritize drafting players with the highest downside (i.e., the safest players), whereas you may draft sleepers (i.e., players with higher upside) for your bench. When choosing which players to start in a given week, if you are predicted to beat a team handily, it may make sense to start the players with the highest downside.

In the second round, the managers draft in reverse order. It continues to “snake” in this way, round after round, so that the person who has the first pick in a given round has the last pick in the next round, and whoever has the last pick in a given round has the first pick in the next round.\n\n\n5.1.2 Auction Draft\nIn an auction draft, the managers are assigned a nomination order and there is a salary cap (e.g., $200). The first manager chooses which player to nominate. Then, the managers bid on that player like in an auction. In order to bid, the manager must raise the price by at least $1. If two managers want to obtain the same player, they may continue to raise the amount until one manager backs out and is no longer to bid by raising the price. The highest bidder wins (i.e., drafts) that player. Then, the second manager nominates a player, and the managers bid on that player. This process repeats until all teams have drafted their allotment of players.\nIn the auction draft, unlike the snake draft, all players are available to all teams. For instance, in the snake draft, the first 9 players drafted are unavailable to the 10th pick of the first round. So, if you have the 10th pick and want the top-ranked player, this player would not be available to you in the snake draft.

You may generate your rankings based one or more of the following:\n- your [player evaluation](player-evaluation.qmd)\n- expert or aggregated rankings\n- players' Average Draft Position (ADP) in other league drafts (for snake drafts), or players' Average Auction Value (AAV) in other league drafts (for auction drafts)\n- expert or aggregated projections\nAn important concept in the draft is “dropoff”, which is described in Section Section 4.8. Dropoff at a given position, is the difference—in terms of projected fantasy points—between (a) the best available player remaining at that position and (b) the second-best available player remaining at that position. If there is a bigger dropoff at a given position, there may be greater value in drafting the top player from that position. For instance, consider the following scenario: “Quarterback A” is projected to score 325 points, and “Quarterback B” is projected to score 320 points. “Tight End A” is projected to score 230 points, and “Tight End B” is projected to score 150 points. In this example, there is a much greater dropoff for Tight Ends than there is for Quarterbacks. Thus, even though “Quarterback A” is projected to score more points than “Tight End A”, “Tight End A” may be more valuable because there is still a good Quarterback available if someone else drafts “Quarterback A”.\n\n5.2.1 Snake Draft\nAn important concept in the snake draft is a player’s value over a typical replacement player at that position (shortened to “value over replacement player”), which is described in Section Section 4.8. A player’s value over a replacement player (VORP) is the difference between (a) a player’s projected fantasy points and (b) the fantasy points that you would be expected to get from a typical bench player at that position.\n\n\n5.2.2 Auction Draft",
