This book is about empiricism (basing theories on observed data) and judgment, prediction, and decision making in the context of uncertainty. The book provides an introduction to modern analytical techniques used to make informed predictions, test theories, and draw conclusions from a given dataset.\nThis book was originally written for a undergraduate-level course entitled, “Fantasy Football: Predictive Analytics and Empiricism”. The chapters provide an overview of topics that each could have its own class and textbook, such as causal inference, factor analysis, cluster analysis, principal component analysis, machine learning, cognitive biases, modern portfolio theory, data visualization, simulation, etc. The book gives readers an overview of the breadth of the approaches to prediction and empiricism. As a consequence, the book does not cover any one technique or approach in great depth.",

    "text": "1.3 Why Focus on Fantasy Football?\nI was fortunate to have an excellent instructor who taught me the value of learning statistics to answer interesting and important questions. That is, I do not find statistics intrinsically interesting; rather, I find them interesting because of what they allow me to do. Many students find statistics intimidating in part because of how it is typically taught—with examples like dice rolls and coin flips that are (seemingly irrelevant and) boring to students. My contention is that applied examples are a more effective lens to teach many concepts in psychology and data analysis. It can be more engaging and relatable to learn statistics in the applied context of sports, a domain that is more intuitive to many. Many people play fantasy sports. This book involves applying statistics to a particular domain (football). People actually want to learn statistical principles and methods when they can apply them to interesting questions (e.g., sports). In my opinion [and supported by evidence; Motz (2013)], this is a much more effective way of engaging people and teaching statistics than in the context of abstract coin flips and dice rolls. Fantasy football relies heavily on prediction—trying to predict which players will perform best and selecting them accordingly. In this way, fantasy football provides a plethora of decision making opportunities in the face of uncertainty, and a wealth of data for analyzing these decisions. However, unlike many other applied domains in psychology, fantasy football (1) allows a person to see the accuracy of their predictions on a timely basis and (2) provides a safe environment for friendly competition. Thus, it provides a unique domain to evaluate—and improve—the accuracy of various prediction models.",

The book aims to help readers evaluate theory in the light of evidence (and vice versa) and to refine decision making in the context of uncertainty. Readers will learn about the ways that psychological science (and related disciplines) poses questions, formulates hypotheses, designs studies to test those questions, and interprets the findings, collectively with the aim to answer questions, improve decision making, and solve problems.\nOf course, this is not a traditional psychology textbook. However, the book incorporates important psychological concepts, such as cognitive biases in judgment and prediction, etc. In the modern world of big data, research and society need people who know how to make sense of the information around us. Psychology is in a prime position to teach applied statistics to a wide variety of students, most of whom will not have careers as psychologists. Psychology can teach the importance of statistics given humans’ cognitive biases. It can also teach about how these biases can influence how people interpret statistics. This book will teach readers the applications of statistics (prediction) and research methods (empiricism) to answer questions they find interesting, while applying scientific and psychological rigor.",

    "text": "2.1.1 The Objective\nThe goal in football is for a team to score more points than their opponent. A game lasts 60 minutes, and it is separated into four 15-minute quarters. The team with the most points when the time runs out wins.\nHere is a video that provides a brief introduction to American football:\n\n\nVideo\nVideo that Provides An Introduction to American Football.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 The Roster\n\n2.1.2.1 Overview\nEach team has 11 players on the field at a time. The particular players who are on the field will depend on the situation, but usually includes one of the three subsets of players:\n\nOffense\nDefense\nSpecial Teams\n\nAn example formation is depicted in Figure Figure 2.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: An Example Football Formation for the Offense and Defense. The solid line indicates the line of scrimmage. The arrow indicates the direction the offense tries to advance the ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2.2 Offense\nThe offense is on the field when the team has the ball.\nPlayers on offense include:\n\nQuarterback (QB)\nRunning Back (RB)\n\nHalfback or Tailback\nFullback (FB)\n\nWide Receiver (WR)\nTight End (TE)\nOffensive Linemen (OL)\n\nCenter (C)\nOffensive Guard (OG)\nOffensive Tackle (OT)\n\n\nQuarterbacks are the most important player on the offense. They help lead the team down the field. Quarterbacks receive the ball from the Center at the beginning of the play, and they can either hand the ball off (typically to a Running Back or Fullback), pass the ball (typically to a Wide Receiver or Tight End), or run the ball. Quarterbacks tend to have a strong arm for throwing the ball far and accurately. Some quarterbacks are fast and are considered “dual threats” to pass or run.\nRunning Backs take a hand-off from the Quarterback to execute a running play. They may also catch short passes from the Quarterback or help protect (i.e., block for) the Quarterback from the defensive players who are trying to tackle the Quarterback. Halfbacks or Tailbacks tend to be quick and agile. Fullbacks tend to be strong and powerful.\nWide Receivers catch passes from the Quarterback to execute a passing play. On running plays, they provide protection for the player running the ball (e.g., the Running Back) so the ball carrier can get as far as possible without being tackled. Wide receivers tend to be tall, fast, have good hands (can catch the ball well), and can jump high.\nTight Ends block for running and passing plays, and they catch passes from the Quarterback. Tight ends tend to be strong and have good hands.\nOffensive Linemen block for running and passing plays. On passing plays, they provide protection for the Quarterback so the Quarterback has time to pass the ball without being tackled. On running plays, they provide protection for the player running the ball (e.g., the Running Back) so the ball carrier can get as far as possible without being tackled. Offensive Linemen tend to be large so they can provide adequate protection for the Quarterback and Running Back.\n\n\n2.1.2.3 Defense\nThe defense is on the field when the team does not have the ball (i.e., when the opposing team has the ball).\nPlayers on defense include:\n\nDefensive Linemen (DL)\n\nDefensive End (DE)\nDefensive Tackle (DT)\n\nLinebacker (LB)\n\nMiddle (or Inside) Linebacker (MLB)\nOutside Linebacker (OLB)\n\n“The Secondary” / Defensive Back (DB)\n\nCornerback (CB)\nSafety (S)\n\nFree Safety (FS)\nStrong Safety (SS)\n\n\n\nThe players on the defense attempt to tackle the offensive players for as short of gains as possible and attempt to prevent completed passes.\nOn passing plays, Defensive Linemen try to apply pressure to the Quarterback and try to sack them. On rushing plays, Defensive Linemen try to tackle the ball carrier. Defensive Linemen tend to be large yet quick so they can apply pressure to the Quarterback.\nLinebackers are versatile in that, on a given play, they may attempt to a) “blitz” to sack the Quarterback, b) stop the Running Back, or c) prevent a completed pass. Linebackers tend to be strong yet agile.\nDefensive Backs are specialist pass defenders. The main role of Cornerbacks is to cover the Wide Receivers. Safeties serve as the last line of defense for longer passes. Defensive Backs tend to be quick and agile.\n\n\n2.1.2.4 Special Teams\nThe special teams involves specialist players who are on the field during all kicking plays including kickoffs, field goals, and punts.\nPlayers on special teams include:\n\nKicker (K)\nPunter (P)\nHolder\nLong Snapper\nPunt Returner\nKick Returner\nand other players intended to block for or to tackle the ball carrier\n\nOn a field goal attempt, the Long Snapper snaps the ball to the Holder, who holds the ball for the Kicker. The Kicker attempts field goals and, during kickoffs, kicks the ball to the opposing team. During kickoffs, the Kick Returner catches the kicked ball and returns it for as many yards as possible. During a punt play, the Long Snapper snaps the ball to the Punter who kicks (i.e., punts) the ball to the opposing team. The Punt Returner catches the punted ball and returns it for as many yards as possible.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 The Field\nThe football field is rectangular and is 120 yards long and 53 1/3 yards wide. At each end of the 120-yard field is a team’s end zone. Each end zone is 10 yards long. Thus, the distance from one end zone to the other end zone is 100 yards. Behind each end zone is a field goal post. A diagram of a football field is depicted in Figure Figure 2.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: A Diagram of a Football Field. The yard markers depict the distance from the nearest end zone. The orange shaded area is called the “red zone”, where chances of scoring points are highest. The original figure was modified to depict field goal posts. (Figure retrieved from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:American_football_field.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 The Gameplay\nAt the beginning of the game, there is a coin flip to determine which teams receives the ball first and which team takes which side of the field. During the kickoff, the kicking team kicks the ball to the receiving team, who has the option to return the kick. The offense starts their possession at the 25 yard line—if there is no return (i.e., a touchback)—or wherever the kick returner is tackled or goes out of bounds.\nThe team with the ball (i.e., the offense) has four opportunities (“downs”) to advance the ball 10 yards. A team can advance the ball either by running it or passing and catching it. At the end of a rushing play, the ball advances to wherever the ball carrier is tackled or goes out of bounds (i.e., wherever the player is “down”). At the end of a passing play, if the thrown ball is caught (i.e., a completed pass), the ball advances to wherever the ball carrier is tackled or goes out of bounds. If the thrown ball is not caught in bounds before the ball hits the ground (i.e., an incomplete pass), the ball does not advance. Wherever the ball is advanced to dictates where the next play begins. The yard position on the field where the next play takes place from is known as the “line of scrimmage”. Neither team can cross the line the line of scrimmage until the next play begins. To begin the play, the ball is placed on the line of scrimmage and the Center gives (or “snaps”) the ball to the Quarterback.\nIf the team advances the ball 10 or more yards within four downs, the team receives a “first down” and is awarded a new set of downs—four more downs to advance the ball 10 more yards. If the team advances the ball all the way to the other team’s end zone, they score a touchdown. If the team fails to advance the ball 10 or more yards within four downs, the team loses the ball, and the other team takes possession at that spot on the field. There are risks of giving the other team the ball with a short distance to score. Thus, on fourth down, instead of trying to advance the ball for a first down, a team may choose to kick a field goal—to get points—or to punt.\nA field goal involves a kicker kicking the ball with an intent to kick the ball through the field goal posts (“uprights”). To score points by making a field goal, the kicked ball must go between the uprights (extended vertically) and over the cross bar.\nPunting involves a punter kicking the ball to the other team with an intent to give their opponent worse field position, thus making it harder for the other team to score. The punting team tries to pin the opponent as close as possible to the opponent’s end zone (i.e., as far as possible from the own team’s end zone), so they have a longer distance to go to score a touchdown.\nThere are multiple ways that ball possession can switch from the offense to the other team. After scoring a touchdown, field goal, or safety, there is a kickoff, in which the scoring team kicks the ball to the opponent. Another way that the ball swithces possession to the other team is if the team commits a turnover. The defense can force a turnover by an interception, fumble recovery, or turnover on downs. A turnover due to an interception occurs when the defense catches the the quarterback’s pass. A turnover due to a fumble recovery occurs when an offensive player, who had possession of the ball, loses the ball before being down or scoring a touchdown and the ball is recovered by the opponent. A turnover on downs occurs when the team attempts to achieve the remainder of the needed 10 yards to go on fourth down but fails.\nOther football-related situations include tackles for loss and sacks. A tackle for loss occurs when a ball carrier is tackled behind the line of scrimmage. A sack occurs when a Quarterback is tackled with the ball behind the line of scrimmage. A pass defended occurs when a defensive player knocks down the ball in the air so that the indended receiver cannot catch the ball.\n\n\n2.1.5 The Scoring\nThe goal of the team with the ball (i.e., the offense) is to score points. It can do this by either advancing the ball into the other team’s end zone (6 points) or by kicking a field goal (3 points). Advancing the ball in the other team’s end zone is called a touchdown. After a touchdown, the offense chooses to attempt either a point-after-touchdown (PAT) or a two-point conversion. A PAT is a short kick attempt from the 15-yard line that, if it goes through the goal posts (“uprights”), is worth 1 point. A two-point conversion is a single-scoring opportunity from the 3-yard line (i.e., 3 yards away from the end zone). If the offense scores (i.e., advances the ball into the end zone) from the 3-yard line, the team is awarded 2 points.\nA team can kick a field goal from any distance as long as the kick goes through the goal posts. The current record for the longest field goal is 66 yards (by Justin Tucker in 2021).\nA safety occurs when the offense is tackled with the ball in their own end zone. When a safety occurs, the opposing team (i.e., defense) is awarded two points.\n\n\n2.1.6 Glossary of Terms\n\nrunning play (“run”) or rushing play (or “rush”)\npassing play (or “pass”)\npassing attempt\nrushing attempt\npassing completion\npassing incompletion\npassing yards\nrushing yards\nreceving yards\nreception\ntouchdown\npassing touchdown\nrushing touchdown\nreceiving touchdown\ntwo-point conversion\nblock\nkickoff\nfield goal\npoint after touchdown (PAT)\nextra point returned\npunt\nfumble lost\nfumble forced\nfumble recovery\ninterception\ntackle\ntackle solo\ntackle assist\ntackle for loss\nsack\npass defended\nsafety",

    "text": "2.2 Fantasy Football\n\n2.2.1 Overview of Fantasy Football\nAs noted in the Introduction, fantasy football is an online game where participants assemble (i.e., “draft”) imaginary teams composed of real-life National Football League (NFL) players.1 The participants are in charge of managing and making strategic decisions for their imaginary team to have the best possible team that will score the most points. Thus, the participants are called “managers”. Managers make decisions such as selecting which players to draft, selecting which players to play (i.e., “start”) on a weekly basis, identifying players to pick up from the remaining pool of available players (i.e., waiver wire), and making trades with other teams. Fantasy football relies heavily on prediction—trying to predict which players will perform best and selecting them accordingly.\nHere is a video that provides a brief introduction to fantasy football:\n\n\nVideo\nVideo that Provides an Introduction to Fantasy Football.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 The Fantasy League\nA fantasy football “league” is composed of various imaginary (i.e., “fantasy”) teams—and their associated manager. In the fantasy league, the managers’ fantasy teams play against each other. A fantasy league is commonly composed of 8, 10, or 12 fantasy teams, but leagues can have more or fewer teams.\n\n\n2.2.3 The Roster of a Fantasy Team\nOn a given roster, a manager has a “starting lineup” and a “bench”. Each week, the manager decides which players on their roster to put in the starting lineup, and which to keep on the bench. In many leagues, a starting lineup is composed of offensive players, a kicker, and defense/special teams:\nOffensive players:\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Offensive Players in the Starting Lineup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition\nTypical Number of Players in Starting Lineup\n\n\n\n\nQuarterback (QB)\n1\n\n\nRunning Back (RB)\n2\n\n\nWide Receiver (WR)\n2\n\n\nTight End (TE)\n1\n\n\nFlex Position\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA “flex position” is a flexible position that can involve a player from various positions: e.g., a Running Back, Wide Receiver, or Tight End.\nKickers:\n\none Kicker (K)\n\nDefense/Special Teams:\n\none Team Defense (DST/D/DEF) or multiple Individual Defensive Players (IDP)\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Scoring\n\n2.2.4.1 Scoring Overview\nIn the game of fantasy football, managers accumulate points on a weekly basis based on players’ actual statistical performances in NFL games. Managers receive points for only those players who are on their starting lineup (not players on their bench). A manager’s goal is to outscore their opponent each week to win matches and ultimately claim victory in the league.
