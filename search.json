    "text": "About the Author\nI am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the University of Iowa. I am a licensed psychologist with expertise in child clinical psychology. Why am I writing about fantasy football and data analysis? Because fantasy football involves the intersection of two things I love: sports and statistics.\nThrough my training, I have learned the value of statistics for answering important questions that I find interesting. In graduate training, I came to the realization that statistics are relevant not only for psychology and science, but also for domains that I enjoy as hobbies, including sports and fantasy sports. I have played in a longstanding fantasy football league for over 20 years (since my junior year of high school) with old friends from high school. I wanted to apply what I was learning about statistics to help others improve their performance in fantasy football and to help people—including those who might not otherwise be interested—to learn statistics. So I began blogging online about the value of applying statistics to improve decision making in fantasy football. Apparently, many people were interested in learning statistics when they could apply them to a domain that they find interesting like fantasy football. My blog eventually became FantasyFootballAnalytics.net, a website that uses advanced statistics to help people win their fantasy football leagues.\nIn terms of my R and statistics background, I have published many peer-reviewed publications that employ advanced statistical methods, have published a book on psychological assessment (Petersen, 2024b, 2024c) that includes applied examples in R, and have published the petersenlab R package (Petersen, 2024a) on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN). I am also a co-author of the ffanalytics R package that provides free utilities for downloading fantasy football projections and additional fantasy-relevant data, and for calculating projected points given your league settings.",

This book is about empiricism (basing theories on observed data) and judgment, prediction, and decision making in the context of uncertainty. The book provides an introduction to modern analytical techniques used to make informed predictions, test theories, and draw conclusions from a given dataset.\nThis book was originally written for a undergraduate-level course entitled, “Fantasy Football: Predictive Analytics and Empiricism”. The chapters provide an overview of topics that each could have its own class and textbook, such as causal inference, factor analysis, cluster analysis, principal component analysis, machine learning, cognitive biases, modern portfolio theory, data visualization, simulation, etc. The book gives readers an overview of the breadth of the approaches to prediction and empiricism. As a consequence, the book does not cover any one technique or approach in great depth.",

    "text": "1.3 Why Focus on Fantasy Football?\nI was fortunate to have an excellent instructor who taught me the value of learning statistics to answer interesting and important questions. That is, I do not find statistics intrinsically interesting; rather, I find them interesting because of what they allow me to do. Many students find statistics intimidating in part because of how it is typically taught—with examples like dice rolls and coin flips that are (seemingly irrelevant and) boring to students. My contention is that applied examples are a more effective lens to teach many concepts in psychology and data analysis. It can be more engaging and relatable to learn statistics in the applied context of sports, a domain that is more intuitive to many. Many people play fantasy sports. This book involves applying statistics to a particular domain (football). People actually want to learn statistical principles and methods when they can apply them to interesting questions (e.g., sports). In my opinion [and supported by evidence; Motz (2013)], this is a much more effective way of engaging people and teaching statistics than in the context of abstract coin flips and dice rolls. Fantasy football relies heavily on prediction—trying to predict which players will perform best and selecting them accordingly. In this way, fantasy football provides a plethora of decision making opportunities in the face of uncertainty, and a wealth of data for analyzing these decisions. However, unlike many other applied domains in psychology, fantasy football (1) allows a person to see the accuracy of their predictions on a timely basis and (2) provides a safe environment for friendly competition. Thus, it provides a unique domain to evaluate—and improve—the accuracy of various prediction models.",

    "text": "1.4 Educational Value\nSkills in statistics, statistical programming, and data analysis are highly valuable. This book includes practical and conceptual tools that build a foundation for critical thinking. The book aims to help readers evaluate theory in the light of evidence (and vice versa) and to refine decision making in the context of uncertainty. Readers will learn about the ways that psychological science (and related disciplines) poses questions, formulates hypotheses, designs studies to test those questions, and interprets the findings, collectively with the aim to answer questions, improve decision making, and solve problems.\nOf course, this is not a traditional psychology textbook. However, the book incorporates important psychological concepts, such as cognitive biases in judgment and prediction, etc. In the modern world of big data, research and society need people who know how to make sense of the information around us. Psychology is in a prime position to teach applied statistics to a wide variety of students, most of whom will not have careers as psychologists. Psychology can teach the importance of statistics given humans’ cognitive biases. It can also teach about how these biases can influence how people interpret statistics. This book will teach readers the applications of statistics (prediction) and research methods (empiricism) to answer questions they find interesting, while applying scientific and psychological rigor.",

    "text": "2.1.1 The Objective\nThe goal in football is for a team to score more points than their opponent. A game lasts 60 minutes, and it is separated into four 15-minute quarters. The team with the most points when the time runs out wins.\nHere is a video that provides a brief introduction to American football:\n\n\nVideo\nVideo that Provides An Introduction to American Football.\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2 The Roster\n\n2.1.2.1 Overview\nEach team has 11 players on the field at a time. The particular players who are on the field will depend on the situation, but usually includes one of the three subsets of players:\n\nOffense\nDefense\nSpecial Teams\n\nAn example formation is depicted in Figure 2.1.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.1: An Example Football Formation for the Offense and Defense. The solid line indicates the line of scrimmage. The arrow indicates the direction the offense tries to advance the ball.\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.2.2 Offense\nThe offense is on the field when the team has the ball.\nPlayers on offense include:\n\nQuarterback (QB)\nRunning Back (RB)\n\nHalfback (HB) or Tailback (TB)\nFullback (FB)\n\nWide Receiver (WR)\nTight End (TE)\nOffensive Linemen (OL), part of the “Offensive Line”\n\nCenter (C)\nOffensive Guard (OG)\nOffensive Tackle (OT)\n\n\nThe quarterback is the most important player on the offense. They help lead the team down the field. The quarterback receives the ball from the Center at the beginning of the play, and they can either hand the ball off (typically to a Running Back or Fullback), pass the ball (typically to a Wide Receiver or Tight End), or run the ball. Quarterbacks tend to have a strong arm for throwing the ball far and accurately. Some quarterbacks are fast and are considered “dual threats” to pass or run.\nRunning Backs take a hand-off from the Quarterback to execute a running play (i.e., a rush). They may also catch short passes from the Quarterback or help protect (i.e., block for) the Quarterback from the defensive players who are trying to tackle the Quarterback. Halfbacks and Tailbacks tend to be quick and agile. Fullbacks tend to be strong and powerful.\nWide Receivers catch passes from the Quarterback to execute a passing play. On running plays, they provide protection for the player running the ball (e.g., the Running Back) so the ball carrier can get as far as possible without being tackled. Wide receivers tend to be tall, fast, have good hands (can catch the ball well), and can jump high.\nTight Ends block for running and passing plays, and they catch passes from the Quarterback. Tight ends tend to be strong and have good hands.\nOffensive Linemen block for running and passing plays. On passing plays, they provide protection for the Quarterback so the Quarterback has time to pass the ball without being tackled. On running plays, they provide protection for the player running the ball (e.g., the Running Back) so the ball carrier can get as far as possible without being tackled. Offensive Linemen tend to be large so they can provide adequate protection for the Quarterback and Running Back.\n\n\n2.1.2.3 Defense\nThe defense is on the field when the team does not have the ball (i.e., when the opposing team has the ball).\nPlayers on defense include:\n\nDefensive Linemen (DL), part of the “Defensive Line”\n\nDefensive End (DE)\nDefensive Tackle (DT)\n\nLinebacker (LB)\n\nMiddle (or Inside) Linebacker (MLB)\nOutside Linebacker (OLB)\n\nDefensive Back (DB), part of the “Secondary”\n\nCornerback (CB)\nSafety (S)\n\nFree Safety (FS)\nStrong Safety (SS)\n\n\n\nThe players on the defense attempt to tackle the offensive players for as short of gains as possible and attempt to prevent completed passes.\nOn passing plays, Defensive Linemen try to apply pressure to the Quarterback and try to tackle the Quarterback behind the line of scrimmage before the Quarterback can throw the ball (i.e., a sack). On rushing plays, Defensive Linemen try to tackle the ball carrier to prevent the ball carrier from advancing the ball (i.e., gaining yards). Defensive Linemen tend to be large yet quick so they can apply pressure to the Quarterback.\nLinebackers are versatile in that, on a given play, they may attempt to a) “blitz” to sack the Quarterback, b) stop the Running Back, or c) prevent a completed pass. Linebackers tend to be strong yet agile.\nDefensive Backs are specialist pass defenders. The main role of Cornerbacks is to cover the Wide Receivers. Safeties serve as the last line of defense for longer passes. Defensive Backs tend to be quick and agile.\n\n\n2.1.2.4 Special Teams\nThe special teams involves specialist players who are on the field during all kicking plays including kickoffs, field goals, and punts.\nPlayers on special teams include:\n\nKicker (K)\nPunter (P)\nHolder\nLong Snapper\nPunt Returner\nKick Returner\nand other players intended to block for or to tackle the ball carrier\n\nOn a field goal attempt, the Long Snapper snaps the ball to the Holder, who holds the ball for the Kicker. The Kicker attempts field goals and, during kickoffs, kicks the ball to the opposing team. During kickoffs, the Kick Returner catches the kicked ball and returns it for as many yards as possible. During a punt play, the Long Snapper snaps the ball to the Punter who kicks (i.e., punts) the ball to the opposing team. The Punt Returner catches the punted ball and returns it for as many yards as possible.\n\n\n\n2.1.3 The Field\nThe football field is rectangular and is 120 yards long and 53 1/3 yards wide (109.73 m x 48.77 m).2 At each end of the 120-yard field is a team’s end zone. Each end zone is 10 yards long (9.14 m). Thus, the distance from one end zone to the other end zone is 100 yards (91.44 m). Behind each end zone is a field goal post. A diagram of a football field is depicted in Figure 2.2.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 2.2: A Diagram of a Football Field. The yard markers depict the distance from the nearest end zone. The orange shaded area is called the “red zone”, where chances of scoring points are highest. The original figure was modified to depict field goal posts. (Figure retrieved from https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:American_football_field.svg)\n\n\n\n\n\n2.1.4 The Gameplay\nAt the beginning of the game, there is a coin flip to determine which teams receives the ball first and which team takes which side of the field. During the kickoff, the kicking team kicks the ball to the receiving team, who has the option to return the kick. The offense starts their possession at the 25 yard line—if there is no return (i.e., a touchback)—or wherever the kick returner is tackled or goes out of bounds.\nThe team with the ball (i.e., the offense) has four opportunities (“downs”) to advance the ball (i.e., gain) 10 yards. A team can advance the ball either by running it or by throwing (i.e., passing) and catching it. At the end of a rushing play, the ball advances to wherever the ball carrier is tackled or goes out of bounds (i.e., wherever the player is “down”). At the end of a passing play, if the thrown ball is caught (i.e., a completed pass), the ball advances to wherever the ball carrier is tackled or goes out of bounds. If the thrown ball is not caught in bounds before the ball hits the ground (i.e., an incomplete pass), the ball does not advance. Wherever the ball is advanced to dictates where the next play begins. The yard position on the field where the next play takes place from is known as the “line of scrimmage”. Neither team can cross the line the line of scrimmage until the next play begins. To begin the play, the ball is placed on the line of scrimmage and the Center gives (or “snaps”) the ball to the Quarterback.\nIf the team advances the ball 10 or more yards within four downs, the team receives a “first down” and is awarded a new set of downs—four more downs to advance the ball 10 more yards. If the team advances the ball all the way to the other team’s end zone, they score a touchdown. If the team fails to advance the ball 10 or more yards within four downs, the team loses the ball, and the other team takes possession at that spot on the field. There are risks of giving the other team the ball with a short distance to score. Thus, on fourth down, instead of trying to advance the ball for a first down, a team may choose to kick a field goal—to get points—or to punt.\nA field goal involves a kicker kicking the ball with an intent to kick the ball through the field goal posts (“uprights”). To score points by making a field goal, the kicked ball must go between the uprights (extended vertically) and over the cross bar.\nPunting involves a punter kicking the ball to the other team with an intent to give their opponent worse field position, thus making it harder for the other team to score. The punting team tries to pin the opponent as close as possible to the opponent’s end zone (i.e., as far as possible from the own team’s end zone), so they have a longer distance to go to score a touchdown.\nThere are multiple ways that ball possession can switch from the offense to the other team. After scoring a touchdown, field goal, or safety, there is a kickoff, in which the scoring team kicks the ball to the opponent. Another way that the ball switches possession to the other team is if the team commits a turnover. The defense can force a turnover by an interception, fumble recovery, or turnover on downs. A turnover due to an interception occurs when a defensive player catches the quarterback’s pass. A turnover due to a fumble recovery occurs when an offensive player, who had possession of the ball, loses the ball before being down or scoring a touchdown and the ball is recovered by the opponent. A turnover on downs occurs when the team attempts on fourth down to achieve the remainder of the needed 10 yards to go but fails.\nOther football-related situations include tackles for loss and sacks. A tackle for loss occurs when a ball carrier is tackled behind the line of scrimmage. A sack occurs when a Quarterback is tackled with the ball behind the line of scrimmage. A pass defended occurs when a defensive player knocks down the ball in the air so that the indended receiver cannot catch the ball.\n\n\n2.1.5 The Scoring\nThe goal of the team with the ball (i.e., the offense) is to score points. It can do this by either advancing the ball into the other team’s end zone (6 points) or by kicking a field goal (3 points). Advancing the ball in the other team’s end zone is called a touchdown. After a touchdown, the offense chooses to attempt either a point-after-touchdown (PAT) or a two-point conversion. A PAT is a short kick attempt from the 15-yard line (i.e., 15 yards away from the end zone) that, if it goes through the goal posts (“uprights”) and over the cross bar, is worth 1 point. A two-point conversion is a single-scoring opportunity from the 3-yard line (i.e., 3 yards away from the end zone).

    "text": "2.2 Fantasy Football\n\n2.2.1 Overview of Fantasy Football\nFantasy football is one of the most widely played games in the history of games. It is estimated that around 62 million people play fantasy sports3, of whom around 29 million play fantasy football.4 As noted in the Introduction, fantasy football is an online game where participants assemble (i.e., “draft”) imaginary teams composed of real-life National Football League (NFL) players.5 The participants are in charge of managing and making strategic decisions for their imaginary team to have the best possible team that will score the most points. Thus, the participants are called “managers”. Managers make decisions such as selecting which players to draft, selecting which players to play (i.e., “start”) on a weekly basis, identifying players to pick up from the remaining pool of available players (i.e., waiver wire), and making trades with other teams. Fantasy football relies heavily on prediction—trying to predict which players will perform best and selecting them accordingly.\nHere is a video that provides a brief introduction to fantasy football:\n\n\nVideo\nVideo that Provides an Introduction to Fantasy Football.\n\n\n\n\n2.2.2 The Fantasy League\nA fantasy football “league” is composed of various imaginary (i.e., “fantasy”) teams—and their associated manager. In the fantasy league, the managers’ fantasy teams play against each other. A fantasy league is commonly composed of 8, 10, or 12 fantasy teams, but leagues can have more or fewer teams.\n\n\n2.2.3 The Roster of a Fantasy Team\nOn a given roster, a manager has a “starting lineup” and a “bench”. Each week, the manager decides which players on their roster to put in the starting lineup, and which to keep on the bench. In many leagues, a starting lineup is composed of offensive players, a kicker, and defense/special teams:\nOffensive players:\n\n\n\nTable 2.1: Offensive Players in the Starting Lineup\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nPosition\nTypical Number of Players in Starting Lineup\n\n\n\n\nQuarterback (QB)\n1\n\n\nRunning Back (RB)\n2\n\n\nWide Receiver (WR)\n2\n\n\nTight End (TE)\n1\n\n\nFlex Position\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nA “flex position” is a flexible position that can involve a player from various positions: e.g., a Running Back, Wide Receiver, or Tight End.\nKickers:\n\none Kicker (K)\n\nDefense/Special Teams:\n\none Team Defense (DST/D/DEF) or multiple Individual Defensive Players (IDP)\n\n\n\n2.2.4 Scoring\n\n2.2.4.1 Scoring Overview\nIn the game of fantasy football, managers accumulate points on a weekly basis based on players’ actual statistical performances in NFL games. Managers receive points for only those players who are on their starting lineup (not players on their bench). A manager’s goal is to outscore their opponent each week to win matches and ultimately claim victory in the league. Scoring settings can differ from league to league.\nBelow are common scoring settings for fantasy leagues.\n\n\n2.2.4.2 Offensive Players\n\n\n\nTable 2.2: Common Scoring Settings for Offensive Players\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical category\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nRushing or receiving TD\n6\n\n\nReturning a kick or punt for a TD\n6\n\n\nReturning or recovering a fumble for a TD\n6\n\n\nPassing TD\n4\n\n\nPassing INT\n−2\n\n\nFumble lost\n−2\n\n\nRushing, passing, or receiving 2-point conversion\n2\n\n\nRushing or receiving yards\n1 point per 10 yards\n\n\nPassing yards\n1 point per 25 yards\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: “TD” = touchdown; “INT” = interception\nOther common (but not necessarily standard) statistical categories include:\n\nreceptions (called “point per reception” [PPR] leagues)\nreturn yards\npassing attempts\nrushing attempts\n\n\n\n2.2.4.3 Kickers\n\n\n\nTable 2.3: Common Scoring Settings for Kickers\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical category\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nFG made: 50+ yards\n5\n\n\nFG made: 40–49 yards\n4\n\n\nFG made: 39 yards or less\n3\n\n\nRushing, passing, or receiving 2-point conversion\n2\n\n\nPoint after touchdown attempt made\n1\n\n\nPoint after touchdown attempt missed\n−1\n\n\nMissed FG: 0–39 yards\n−2\n\n\nMissed FG: 40–49 yards\n−1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: “FG” = field goal\n\n\n2.2.4.4 Team Defense/Special Teams\n\n\n\nTable 2.4: Common Scoring Settings for Team Defense/Special Teams\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical category\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nDefensive or special teams TD\n3\n\n\nInterception\n2\n\n\nFumble recovery\n2\n\n\nBlocked punt, PAT, or FG\n2\n\n\nSafety\n2\n\n\nSack\n1\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: “TD” = touchdown; “PAT” = point after touchdown; “FG” = field goal\n\n\n2.2.4.5 Individual Defensive Players\n\n\n\nTable 2.5: Common Scoring Settings for Individual Defensive Players\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nStatistical category\nPoints\n\n\n\n\nTackle solo\n1\n\n\nTackle assist\n0.5\n\n\nTackle for loss\n1\n\n\nSack\n2\n\n\nInterception\n4\n\n\nFumble forced\n2\n\n\nFumble recovery\n2\n\n\nTD\n6\n\n\nSafety\n2\n\n\nPass defended\n1\n\n\nBlocked kick\n2\n\n\nExtra point returned\n2\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote: “TD” = touchdown\nOther common (but not necessarily standard) statistical categories include:\n\nturnover return yards\n\n\n\n2.2.4.6 Common Scoring Abbreviations\n\n“TD” = touchdown\n“INT” = interception\n“yds” = yards\n“ATT” = attempts\n“2-pt conversion” = two-point conversion\n“FG” = field goal\n“PAT” = point after touchdown (i.e., extra point/point after attempt)\n\n\n\n\n\nCorston, R., & Colman, A.

    "text": "3.16 Merging/Joins\n\n3.16.1 Overview\nMerging (also called joining) merges two data objects using a shared set of variables called “keys.” The keys are the variable(s) that uniquely identify each row (i.e., they account for the levels of nesting). In some data objects, the key might be the player’s identification number (e.g., player_id). However, some data objects have multiple keys. For instance, in long form data objects, each participant may have multiple rows corresponding to multiple seasons. In this case, the keys may be player_id and season. If a participant has multiple rows corresponding to seasons and games/weeks, the keys are player_id, season, and week. In general, each row should have a value on each of the keys; there should be no missingness in the keys.\nTo merge two objects, the key(s) that will be used to match the records must be present in both objects. The keys are used to merge the variables in object 1 (x) with the variables in object 2 (y). Different merge types select different rows to merge.\nNote: if the two objects include variables with the same name (apart from the keys), R will not know how you want each to appear in the merged object. So, it will add a suffix (e.g., .x, .y) to each common variable to indicate which object (i.e., object x or object y) the variable came from, where object x is the first object—i.e., the object to which object y (the second object) is merged. In general, apart from the keys, you should not include variables with the same name in two objects to be merged. To prevent this, either remove or rename the shared variable in one of the objects, or include the shared variable as a key. However, as described above, you should include it as a key only if it uniquely identifies each row in terms of levels of nesting.\n\n3.16.2 Data Before Merging\nHere are the data in the players object:\n\nCodeplayers\n\n\n  \n\n\nCodedim(players)\n\n[1] 12 10\n\n\nThe data are structured in ID form. That is, every row in the dataset is uniquely identified by the variable, ID.\nHere are the data in the fantasyPoints object:\n\nCodefantasyPoints\n\n\n  \n\n\nCodedim(fantasyPoints)\n\n[1] 4 2\n\n\n\n3.16.3 Types of Joins\n\n3.16.3.1 Visual Overview of Join Types\nBelow is a visual that depicts various types of merges/joins. Object x is the circle labeled as x. Object y is the circle labeled as y. The area of overlap in the Venn diagram indicates the rows on the keys that are shared between the two objects (e.g., the same player_id, season, and week). The non-overlapping area indicates the rows on the keys that are unique to each object. The shaded blue area indicates which rows (on the keys) are kept in the merged object from each of the two objects, when using each of the merge types. For instance, a left outer join keeps the shared rows and the rows that are unique to object x, but it drops the rows that are unique to object y.\n\n\nTypes of merges/joins\n\n\n3.16.3.2 Full Outer Join\nA full outer join includes all rows in \\(x\\) or \\(y\\). It returns columns from \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Here is how to merge two data frames using a full outer join (i.e., “full join”):\n\nCodefullJoinData &lt;- full_join(\n  players,\n  fantasyPoints,\n  by = \"ID\")\n\nfullJoinData\n\n\n  \n\n\nCodedim(fullJoinData)\n\n[1] 14 11\n\n\n\n3.16.3.3 Left Outer Join\nA left outer join includes all rows in \\(x\\). It returns columns from \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Here is how to merge two data frames using a left outer join (“left join”):\n\nCodeleftJoinData &lt;- left_join(\n  players,\n  fantasyPoints,\n  by = \"ID\")\n\nleftJoinData\n\n\n  \n\n\nCodedim(leftJoinData)\n\n[1] 12 11\n\n\n\n3.16.3.4 Right Outer Join\nA right outer join includes all rows in \\(y\\). It returns columns from \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Here is how to merge two data frames using a right outer join (“right join”):\n\nCoderightJoinData &lt;- right_join(\n  players,\n  fantasyPoints,\n  by = \"ID\")\n\nrightJoinData\n\n\n  \n\n\nCodedim(rightJoinData)\n\n[1]  4 11\n\n\n\n3.16.3.5 Inner Join\nAn inner join includes all rows that are in both \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). An inner join will return one row of \\(x\\) for each matching row of \\(y\\), and can duplicate values of records on either side (left or right) if \\(x\\) and \\(y\\) have more than one matching record. It returns columns from \\(x\\) and \\(y\\). Here is how to merge two data frames using an inner join:\n\nCodeinnerJoinData &lt;- inner_join(\n  players,\n  fantasyPoints,\n  by = \"ID\")\n\ninnerJoinData\n\n\n  \n\n\nCodedim(innerJoinData)\n\n[1]  2 11\n\n\n\n3.16.3.6 Semi Join\nA semi join is a filter. A left semi join returns all rows from \\(x\\) with a match in \\(y\\). That is, it filters out records from \\(x\\) that are not in \\(y\\). Unlike an inner join, a left semi join will never duplicate rows of \\(x\\), and it includes columns from only \\(x\\) (not from \\(y\\)). Here is how to merge two data frames using a left semi join:\n\nCodesemiJoinData &lt;- semi_join(\n  players,\n  fantasyPoints,\n  by = \"ID\")\n\nsemiJoinData\n\n\n  \n\n\nCodedim(semiJoinData)\n\n[1]  2 10\n\n\n\n3.16.3.7 Anti Join\nAn anti join is a filter. A left anti join returns all rows from \\(x\\) without a match in \\(y\\). That is, it filters out records from \\(x\\) that are in \\(y\\). It returns columns from only \\(x\\) (not from \\(y\\)). Here is how to merge two data frames using a left anti join:\n\nCodeantiJoinData &lt;- anti_join(\n  players,\n  fantasyPoints,\n  by = \"ID\")\n\nantiJoinData\n\n\n  \n\n\nCodedim(antiJoinData)\n\n[1] 10 10\n\n\n\n3.16.3.8 Cross Join\nA cross join combines each row in \\(x\\) with each row in \\(y\\).\n\nCodecrossJoinData &lt;- cross_join(\n  players,\n  fantasyPoints)\n\ncrossJoinData\n\n\n  \n\n\nCodedim(crossJoinData)\n\n[1] 48 12",

    "text": "3.17 Transform Data from Long to Wide\nDepending on the analysis, it may be important to restructure the data to be in long or wide form. When the data are in wide form, each player has only one row. When the data are in long form, each player has multiple rows—e.g., a row for each game. The data structure is called wide or long form because a dataset in wide form has more columns and fewer rows (i.e., it appears wider and shorter), whereas a dataset in long form has more rows and fewer columns (i.e., it appears narrower and taller).\nHere are the data in the nfl_actualStats_offense_weekly object. The data are structured in “player-season-week form”. That is, every row in the dataset is uniquely identified by the variables, player_id, season, and week. This is an example of long form, because each player has multiple rows.\nOriginal data:\n\nCodedataLong &lt;- nfl_actualStats_offense_weekly %&gt;% \n  select(player_id, player_display_name, season,

Height allows players to see over opponents and to reach balls higher in the air. Thus, greater height is particularly valuable for Quarterbacks and Wide Receivers. Heavier players are tougher to budge and to tackle. Greater weight is particularly valuable for Linemen, Fullbacks, and Tight Ends, but it can also be valuable—to a deree—for Quarterbacks, Running Backs, and Wide Receivers. Hand size and wing span is particularly valuable for people catching the ball; thus, a larger hand size and longer wing span are particularly valuable for Wide Receivers and Tight Ends.\nIn terms of body function, we can consider a player’s agility, strength, speed, acceleration/explosiveness, and jumping ability. For Wide Receivers, speed, explosiveness, and jumping ability are particularly valuable. For Running Backs, agility, strength, speed, and explosiveness are particularly valuable.\nMany aspects of a player’s athletic profile are available from the National Football League (NFL) Combine, which is especially relevant for evaluating rookies. We demonstrate how to import data from the NFL Combine in Section 3.4.6. There are also calculators that integrate information about body shape and information from the NFL Combine to determine a player’s relative athletic score (RAS) for their position: https://ras.football/ras-calculator/",

    "text": "4.4 Historical Performance\n\n4.4.1 Overview\n\n“The best predictor of future behavior is past behavior.” – Unknown\n\n\n“Past performance does not guarantee future results.” – A common disclaimer about investments.\n\nFactors relating to historical performance to consider could include:\n\nperformance in college\n\ndraft position\n\n\nperformance in the NFL\nefficiency\nconsistency\n\nIt is important to consider a player’s past performance. However, the extent to which historical performance may predict future performance may depend on many factors such as (a) the similarity of the prior situation to the current situation, (b) how long ago the prior situation was, and (c) the extent to which the player (or situation) has changed in the interim. For rookies, the player does not have prior seasons of performance in the NFL to draw upon. Thus, when evaluating rookies, it can be helpful to consider their performance in college or in their prior leagues. However, there are large differences between the situation in college and the situation in the NFL, so prior success in college may not portend future success in the NFL. An indicator that intends to be prognostic of future performance, and that accounts for past performance, is a player’s draft position—that is, how early (or late) was a player selected in the NFL Draft. The earlier a player was selected in the NFL Draft, the greater likelihood that the player will perform well.\nFor players who have played in the NFL, past performance becomes more relevant because, presumably, the prior situation is more similar (than was their situation in college) to their current situation. Nevertheless, lots of things change from game to game and season to season: injuries, coaches, coaching strategies, teammates, etc. So just because a player performed well or poorly in a given game or season does not necessarily mean that they will perform similarly in subsequent games/seasons. Nevertheless, historical performance is one of the best indicators we have.\nWe demonstrate how to import historical player statistics in Section 3.4.12. We demonstrate how to calculate historical player statistics in Section 3.19.1. We demonstrate how to calculate historical fantasy points in Section 3.19.2.\n\n4.4.2 Efficiency\nIn addition to how many fantasy points a player scores in terms of historical performance, we also care about efficiency and consistency. How efficient were they given the number of opportunities they had? If they were relatively more efficient, they will likely score more points than many of their peers when given more opportunities. If they were relativelly inefficient, their capacity to score fantasy points may be more dependent on touches/opportunities. Efficiency might be operationalized by indicators such as yards per passing attempt, yards per rushing attempt, yards per target, yards per reception, etc.\n\n4.4.3 Consistency\nIn terms of consistency, how consistent was the player they from game to game and from season to season? For instance, we could examine the standard deviations of players’ fantasy points across games in a given season. However, the standard deviation tends to be upwardly biased as the mean increases. So, we can account for the player’s mean fantasy points per game by dividing their game-to-game standard deviation of fantasy points (\\(\\sigma\\)) by their mean fantasy points across games (\\(\\mu\\)). This is known as the coefficient of variation (CV), which is provided in Equation 4.1.\n\\[\nCV = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\mu}\n\\tag{4.1}\\]\nPlayers with a lower standard deviation and a lower coefficient of variation (of fantasy points across games) are more consistent. In the example below, Player 2 might be preferable to Player 1 because Player 2 is more consistent; Player 1 is more “boom-or-bust.” Despite showing a similar mean of fantasy points across weeks, Player 2 shows a smaller week-to-week standard deviation and coefficient of variation.\n\nCodeset.seed(1)\n\nplayerScoresByWeek &lt;- data.frame(\n  player1_scores = rnorm(17, mean = 20, sd = 7),\n  player2_scores = rnorm(17, mean = 20, sd = 4),\n  player3_scores = rnorm(17, mean = 10, sd = 4),\n  player4_scores = rnorm(17, mean = 10, sd = 1)\n)\n\nconsistencyData &lt;- data.frame(t(playerScoresByWeek))\n\nweekNames &lt;- paste(\"week\", 1:17, sep = \"\")\n\nnames(consistencyData) &lt;- weekNames\nrow.names(consistencyData) &lt;- NULL\n\nconsistencyData$mean &lt;- rowMeans(consistencyData[,weekNames])\nconsistencyData$sd &lt;- apply(consistencyData, 1, sd)\nconsistencyData$cv &lt;- consistencyData$sd / consistencyData$mean\n\nconsistencyData$player &lt;- c(1, 2, 3, 4)\n\nconsistencyData &lt;- consistencyData %&gt;% \n  select(player, mean, sd, cv, week1:week17)\n\nround(consistencyData, 2)",

A player is embedded within a broader team context; it is important to consider the strength of their team context insofar as it may support— or detract from—a player’s performance. For instance, for a Quarterback, it is important to consider how strong the pass blocking is from the Offensive Line. Will they have enough time to throw the ball, or will they be constantly under pressure to be sacked? It is also important to consider the strength of the pass catchers—the Wide Receivers and Tight Ends. For a Running Back, it is important to consider how strong the run blocking is from the Offensive Line. For a Wide Receiver, it is important to consider how strong the pass blocking is, and how strong the Quarterback is.\nIt is also important to consider a player’s role on the team. Is the player a starter or a backup? Related to this, it is important to consider the strength of one’s teammates. For a given Running Back, if a teammate is better at running the ball, this may take away from how much the player sees the field. For a given Wide Receiver, if a teammate is better at catching the ball, this may take some targets away from the player. However, the team’s top defensive back is often matched up against the team’s top Wide Receiver. So, if the team’s top Wide Receiver is matched up against a particularly strong Defensive Back, the second- and third-best Wide Receivers may more targets than usual.\nIt is also important to consider a player’s opportunity and usage, which are influenced by many factors, including the skill of the player, the skill of their teammates, the role of the player on the team, the coaching style, the strategy of the opposing team, game scripts, etc. In terms of the player’s opportunity and usage, how many snaps do they get? How many touches and/or targets do they receive? Being on the field for more snaps and receiving more touches and/or targets means that the player has more opportunities to score fantasy points. Are they targeted in the red zone? Red zone targets are more likely to lead to touchdown scoring opportunities, which are particularly valuable in fantasy football.",

For instance, a contract may have a performance incentive that provides a player greater compensation if they achieve a particular performance milestone (e.g., receiving yards). Another potential incentive is if a player is in what is called their “contract year” (i.e., the last year of their current contract). If a player is in the last year of their current contract, they have an incentive to perform well so they can get re-signed to a new contract.",

    "text": "4.10 Fantasy Value\n\n4.10.1 Sources From Which to Evaluate Fantasy Value\nThere are several sources that one can draw upon to evaluate a player’s fantasy value:\n\nexpert or aggregated rankings\nlayperson rankings\n\nplayers’ Average Draft Position (ADP) in other league snake drafts\n\nplayers’ Average Auction Value (AAV) in other league auction drafts\n\n\n\nexpert or aggregated projections\n\n\n4.10.1.1 Expert Fantasy Rankings\nFantasy rankings (by so-called “experts”) are provided by many sources. To reduce some of the bias due to a given source, some services aggregate projections across sources, consistent with a “wisdom of the crowd” approach. FantasyPros aggregates fantasy rankings across sources. Fantasy Football Analytics creates fantasy rankings from projections that are aggregated across sources (see the webapp here: https://apps.fantasyfootballanalytics.net).\n\n4.10.1.2 Layperson Fantasy Rankings: ADP and AAV\nAverage Draft Position (ADP) and Average Auction Value (AAV), are based on league drafts, mostly composed of everyday people. ADP is based on snake drafts, whereas AAV is based on auction drafts. Thus, ADP and AAV are consistent with a “wisdom of the crowd” approach, and I refer to them as forms of rankings by laypeople. ADP data are provided by FantasyPros. AAV data are also provided by FantasyPros.\n\n4.10.1.3 Projections\nProjections are provided by various sources. Projections (and rankings, for that matter) are a bit of a black box. It is often unclear how they were derived by a particular source. That is, it is unclear how much of the projection was based on statistical analysis versus conjecture.\nTo reduce some of the bias due to a given source, some services aggregate projections across sources, consistent with a “wisdom of the crowd” approach. Projections that are aggregated across sources are provided by Fantasy Football Analytics (see the webapp here: https://apps.fantasyfootballanalytics.net) and by FantasyPros.\n\n4.10.1.4 Benefits of Using Projections Rather than Rankings\nIt is important to keep in mind that rankings, ADP, and AAV are specific to roster and scoring settings of a particular league. For instance, in point-per-reception (PPR) leagues, players who catch lots of passes (Wide Receivers, Tight Ends, and some Running Backs) are valued more highly. As another example, Quarterbacks are valued more highly in 2-Quarterback leagues. Thus, if using rankings, ADP, or AAV, it is important to find ones from leagues that mirror—as closely as possible—your league settings.\nProjected statistics (e.g., projected passing touchdowns) are agnostic to league settings and can thus be used to generate league-specific fantasy projections and rankings. Thus, projected statisitics may be more useful than rankings because they can be used to generate rankings for your particular league settings. For instance, if you know how many touchdowns, yards, and interceptions a Quarterback is a projected to throw (in addition to any other relevant categories for the player, e.g., rushing yards and touchdowns), you can calculate how many fantasy points the Quarterback is expected to gain in your league (or in any league). Thus, you can calculate ranking from projections, but you cannot reverse engineer projections from rankings.\n\n4.10.2 Indices to Evaluate Fantasy Value\nBased on the sources above (rankings, ADP, AAV, and projections), we can derive multiple indices to evaluate fantasy value. There are many potential indices that can be worthwhile to consider, including a player’s:\n\ndropoff\nvalue over replacement player (VORP)\nuncertainty\n\n\n4.10.2.1 Dropoff\nA player’s dropoff is the difference between (a) the player’s projected points and (b) the projected points of the next-best player at that position.\n\n4.10.2.2 Value Over Replacement Player\nBecause players from some positions (e.g., Quarterbacks) tend to score more points than players from other positions (e.g., Wide Receivers), it would be inadvisable to compare players across different positions based on projected points. In order to more fairly compare players across positions, we can consider a player’s value over a typical replacement player at that position (shortened to “value over replacement player”). A player’s value over a replacement player (VORP) is the difference between (a) a player’s projected fantasy points and (b) the fantasy points that you would be expected to get from a typical bench player at that position. Thus, VORP provides an index of how much added value a player provides.\n\n4.10.2.3 Uncertainty\nA player’s uncertainty is how much variability there is in projections or rankings for a given player across sources. For instance, consider a scenario where three experts provide ratings about two players, Player A and Player B. Player A is projected to score 300, 310, and 290 points by experts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Player B is projected to score 400, 300, and 200 points by experts 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In this case, both players are (on average) projected to score the same number of points (300).\n\nCodeexampleData &lt;- data.frame(\n  player = c(rep(\"A\", 3), rep(\"B\", 3)),\n  expert = c(1:3, 1:3),\n  projectedPoints = c(300, 310, 290, 400, 300, 200)\n)\n\nplayerA_mean &lt;- mean(exampleData$projectedPoints[which(exampleData$player == \"A\")])\nplayerB_mean &lt;- mean(exampleData$projectedPoints[which(exampleData$player == \"B\")])\n\nplayerA_sd &lt;- sd(exampleData$projectedPoints[which(exampleData$player == \"A\")])\nplayerB_sd &lt;- sd(exampleData$projectedPoints[which(exampleData$player == \"B\")])\n\nplayerA_cv &lt;- playerA_mean / playerA_sd\nplayerB_cv &lt;- playerB_mean / playerB_sd\n\n\n\nCodeplayerA_mean\n\n[1] 300\n\nCodeplayerB_mean\n\n[1] 300\n\n\nHowever, the players differ considerably in their uncertainty (i.e., the source-to-source variability in their projections), as operationalized with the standard deviation and coefficient variation of projected points across sources for a given player.\n\nCodeplayerA_sd\n\n[1] 10\n\nCodeplayerB_sd\n\n[1] 100\n\nCodeplayerA_cv\n\n[1] 30\n\nCodeplayerB_cv\n\n[1] 3\n\n\nHere is a depiction of a density plot of projected points for a player with a low, medium, and high uncertainty:\n\nCodeplayerA &lt;- rnorm(1000000, mean = 150, sd = 5)\nplayerB &lt;- rnorm(1000000, mean = 150, sd = 15)\nplayerC &lt;- rnorm(1000000, mean = 150, sd = 30)\n\nmydata &lt;- data.frame(playerA, playerB, playerC)\n\nmydata_long &lt;- mydata %&gt;% \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols = everything(),\n    names_to = \"player\",\n    values_to = \"points\"\n  ) %&gt;% \n  mutate(\n    name = case_match(\n      player,\n      \"playerA\" ~ \"Player A\",\n      \"playerB\" ~ \"Player B\",\n      \"playerC\" ~ \"Player C\",\n    )\n  )\n\nggplot2::ggplot(\n  data = mydata_long,\n  ggplot2::aes(\n    x = points,\n    fill = name\n  )\n) +\n  ggplot2::geom_density(alpha = .3) + \n  ggplot2::labs(\n    x = \"Players' Projected Points\",\n    title = \"Density Plot of Projected Points for Three Players\"\n  ) +\n  ggplot2::theme_classic() +\n  ggplot2::theme(legend.title = element_blank())\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 4.1: Density Plot of Projected Points for Three Players\n\n\n\n\nUncertainty is not necessarily a bad characteristic of a player’s projected points.

When thinking about a player’s value, it can be worth thinking of a player’s upside and a player’s downside. Player that are more consistent may show higher downside but a lower upside. Younger, less experienced players may show a higher upside but a lower downside.\nThe extent to which you prioritize a higher upside versus a higher downside may depend on many factors. For instance, when drafting players, you may prioritize drafting players with the highest downside (i.e., the safest players), whereas you may draft sleepers (i.e., players with higher upside) for your bench. When choosing which players to start in a given week, if you are predicted to beat a team handily, it may make sense to start the players with the highest downside. By contrast, if you are predicted to lose to a team by a good margin, it may make sense to start the players with the highest upside.\n\n\n\n\nCorston, R., & Colman, A. M. (2000).

    "text": "5.2 Types of Fantasy Drafts\nThere are several types of drafts in fantasy football. The most common types of drafts are snake drafts and auction drafts.\n\n5.2.1 Snake Draft\nIn a snake draft, the participants (i.e., managers) are assigned a draft order. In the first round, the managers draft in that order. In the second round, the managers draft in reverse order. It continues to “snake” in this way, round after round, so that the person who has the first pick in a given round has the last pick in the next round, and whoever has the last pick in a given round has the first pick in the next round.\n\n5.2.2 Auction Draft\nIn an auction draft, the managers are assigned a nomination order and there is a salary cap (e.g., $200). The first manager chooses which player to nominate. Then, the managers bid on that player like in an auction. In order to bid, the manager must raise the price by at least $1. If two managers want to obtain the same player, they may continue to raise the amount until one manager backs out and is no longer to bid by raising the price. The highest bidder wins (i.e., drafts) that player. Then, the second manager nominates a player, and the managers bid on that player. This process repeats until all teams have drafted their allotment of players.\n\n5.2.3 Comparison\nSnake drafts are more common than auction drafts. Snake drafts tend to be quicker than auction drafts. However, auction drafts are more fair than snake drafts. In an auction draft, unlike a snake draft, all players are available to all teams. For instance, in a snake draft, the first 9 players drafted are unavailable to the 10th pick of the first round. So, if you have the 10th pick and want the top-ranked player, this player would not be available to you in the snake draft. However, in the auction draft, every player is available to every manager, so long as the manager is able and willing to bid enough.",

    "section": "\n5.3 Draft Strategy",
    "text": "5.3 Draft Strategy\n\n5.3.1 Overview\nThere is no one “right” draft strategy. Sometimes it works best to “zig” when everyone else is “zagging”. For instance, if you notice that everyone else is drafting Wide Receivers, this may mean that other managers are over-valuing Wide Receivers, and this could be a nice opportunity to draft a Running Back for good value.\nIn general, you will first want to generate the rankings you will use to select which players to prioritize. You may generate your rankings based one or more of the following:\n\nyour evaluation of players\n\nexpert or aggregated rankings\n\nlayperson rankings\n\nplayers’ Average Draft Position (ADP) in other league drafts (for snake drafts)\nplayers’ Average Auction Value (AAV) in other league drafts (for auction drafts)\n\n\nexpert or aggregated projections\nindices derived from rankings and projections\n\nSection 4.10.1 describes where to obtain aggregated rankings, aggregated projections, ADP, and AAV data.\nAn important concept in the draft is “dropoff”, which is described in Section 4.10.2.1. Dropoff at a given position, is the difference—in terms of projected fantasy points—between (a) the best available player remaining at that position and (b) the second-best available player remaining at that position. If there is a bigger dropoff at a given position, there may be greater value in drafting the top player from that position. For instance, consider the following scenario: “Quarterback A” is projected to score 325 points, and “Quarterback B” is projected to score 320 points. “Tight End A” is projected to score 230 points, and “Tight End B” is projected to score 150 points. In this example, there is a much greater dropoff for Tight Ends than there is for Quarterbacks. Thus, even though “Quarterback A” is projected to score more points than “Tight End A”, “Tight End A” may be more valuable because there is still a good Quarterback available if someone else drafts “Quarterback A”.\nAnother important concept is a player’s value over a typical replacement player at that position (shortened to “value over replacement player”; VORP), which is described in Section 4.10.2.2.\nAnother important concept is a player’s uncertainty, which is described in Section 4.10.2.3.\nIn both snake and auction draft formats, your goal is to draft the team whose weekly starting lineup scores the most points and thus the collection of players with the greatest VORP. For your starting lineup, it may make sense—especially with your earliest selections—when comparing two players with equivalent VORP, to prioritize players with higher consistency and lower uncertainty, because they may be considered “safer” with a higher floor. However, when drafting players for your bench, it make make more sense to prioritize high-risk, high reward players with greater uncertainty, because they may have a higher ceiling. Players with a higher ceiling have a potential to be “sleepers”—players who are valued low (i.e., with a high ADP or low AAV) and who outperform their valuation. Note that, although players with greater uncertainty are high-risk, high-reward players, selecting this kind of a player for your bench (i.e., in a late round or for a small cost) is a lower risk selection, because you have less to lose with later/lower-cost picks. That is, even though the player is higher risk, selecting a higher risk player for your bench is a lower risk decision.\nThe Spurs in the National Basketball Association (NBA) were well-reputed for excelling in this draft strategy (archived at https://perma.cc/X7NW-WZC6). They frequently used their second-round picks to draft high-risk, high-reward players. Sometimes, the secound round pick was a bust, but they have little to lose with a failed second round pick. Other times, their second round picks—including Willie Anderson, DeJuan Blair, Goran Dragic, Luis Scola, and Manu Ginóbili—greatly outperformed expectations. Thanks, in part, to this draft strategy, the team showed strong extended success for nearly three decades from 1989 through the late-2010s.\nHowever, the draft strategies to achieve the “optimal lineup” differ between snake versus auction drafts.\n\n5.3.2 Snake Draft\nIn general, your goal is to draft the team whose weekly starting lineup has the greatest VORP. Consequently, you are often looking to pick the player with the highest VORP at a given selection, while keeping in mind (a) the dropoff of players at other positions and (b) which players may be available at subsequent picks so that you do not sacrifice too much later value with a given selection. For instance, if a particular Quarterback has a slightly higher VORP than a particular Running Back, but the Quarterback is likely to be available at the manager’s next pick but the Running Back is likely to be unavailable at their next pick, it might make more sense to draft the Running Back.\n\n5.3.3 Auction Draft\nAccording to an analysis by the Harvard Sports Analysis Collective (archived at https://perma.cc/P7RX-92UU), the majority of the manager’s salary cap should be spent on the starting lineup, and you should spend less on bench players. This is known as the “stars and scrubs” draft strategy. Based on the analysis, the author recommended applying a 10% premium to the top players and a 10% discount to the lower-tiered players. The idea behind the approach is that a player on your bench does not contribute to the team’s points and, thus, most players drafted to your bench do not contribute much to the team’s points throughout the season. That said, bench players can be important in the case of a starter’s injury or under-performance. So, it is recommended to draft starters with lower uncertainty who are safer. In contrast to your starting lineup, you may look to draft players on your bench who have greater uncertainty for their high reward potential in a low-risk selection given the lower price.\n\n\n\n\nCorston, R., & Colman, A.

    "text": "6.2 Sample vs Population\nIn research, it is important to distinguish between the sample and the target population. The target population is who you want your study’s findings to generalize to. For instance, if we want our findings to lead to inferences we can draw regarding all current NFL players, then NFL players are our target population. However, despite our best efforts to recruit all NFL players into our study, we may not succeed in doing that. The participants (i.e., people or players) who we successfully recruit to be in our study represent our sample.\nIt is rare for the sample to include all people who are in the target population. It can be costly to recruit large samples, and many potential participants may decline to participate for a variety of reasons (insufficient time, lack of interest in the study, distrust of scientists, etc.). Thus, our goals are (a) to recruit as many people from the population as possible and (b) for the sample to be as representative of the population as possible.\nFor increasing the representativeness of the sample (with respect to the population), we might conduct a random sample, in which each person in the population (i.e., each NFL player) has equal likelihood of being selected. For instance, we might randomly select 250 players to recruit to the study. True random samples, though strong in aspiration, are difficult and costly to achieve. In reality, many researchers conduct convenience sampling. A convenience sample is recruited because it is convenient (i.e., less costly and time-consuming).\nFor instance, many studies examine college students—in part, because they are easy to recruit. If our target population is NFL players but we are unable to recruit NFL players into our study, we could easily recruit a large sample of college students. Although the convenience sample may afford a very large sample, the college student sample may not be representative of the target population (NFL players). Thus, the findings in our study may not generalize to NFL players—that is, what we learn in college students may not apply in the same way among NFL players. For instance, if we learn that consumption of sports drinks (compared to drinking only water) improves running speed among college students, that may not be the case among NFL players.",

    "section": "\n6.3 Research Designs",
    "text": "6.3 Research Designs\nThere are three broad types of research designs:\n\nexperiment\ncorrelational/observational study\ncase study\n\n\n6.3.1 Experiment\nIn an experiment, there are one or more things (i.e., variables) that we manipulate to see how the manipulation influences the process of interest. The variable that we manipulate is the independent variable. By contast, the dependent variable is the variable that we evaluate to determine whether it was influenced by the manipulation (i.e., by the independent variable).Besides the independent and dependent variables, the researcher attempts to hold everything else constant through processes including standardization and random assignment. Standardization involves using the same procedures to assess each participant, so that scores can be fairly compared across participants (and groups). Random assignment involves randomly assigning participants to conditions of the independent variable, so the people in each condition are comparable and do not differ systematically.\nFor instance, we may be interested to evaluate whether players perform better (e.g., run faster) if they drink a sports drink compared when they drink only water. Our hypothesis might be that players will be expected to perform better when they drink a sports drink (compared to when they drink only water). To this this research question and hypothesis, we might conduct an experiment by randomly assigning some players during practice to receive a sports drink and some players to receive only water. In this case, our independent variable is whether the player receives a sports drink. Our dependent variable might be their 40-yard dash time during practice.\n\n6.3.2 Correlational/Observational Study\nIn a correlational (aka observational) study, we do not manipulate a variable to see how the manipulation influences another variable. Instead, we examine how two variables, a predictor and an outcome variable, are associated. The hypothesized cause is called the predictor variable. The hypothesized effect is called the outcome variable. In this way, the predictor variable is similar to the independent variable, and the outcome variable is similar to the dependent variable. However, unlike the independent and dependent variables in an experiment, the predictor and outcome variables in a correlational study are not manipulated.\nFor instance, to use a correlational study to test the possibility that players who drink sports drinks perform better than players who drink only water, we could examine whether the players who drink sports drinks during a game score more fantasy points than players who drink only water during the game. In this case, our predictor variable is whether the players drinks sports drinks during a game. Our outcome variable is the number of fantasy points the player scored.\n\n6.3.2.1 Correlation Does Not Imply Causation\nAs the maxim goes, “correlation does not imply causation”—just because two variables are associated does not necessarily mean that they are causally related.\nJust because \\(X\\) is associated with \\(Y\\) does not mean that \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\). Consider that you find an association between variables \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\).\nThere are several reasons why you might observe an association between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\):\n\n\n\\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\)\n\n\n\\(Y\\) causes \\(X\\)\n\na third variable (i.e., confound), \\(Z\\), influences both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\)\n\nthe association between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is spurious\n\nFor instance, one possibility is that the association we observed reflects our hypothesis that \\(X\\) causes \\(Y\\), as depicted in Figure 6.1. That is, consumption of more sports drink may improve players’ performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.1: Hypothesized Causal Effect Based on an Observed Association Between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), Such That \\(X\\) Causes \\(Y\\).\n\n\nHowever, a second possibility is that the association reflects the opposite direction of effect, where \\(Y\\) actually causes \\(X\\), as depicted in Figure 6.2. For instance, greater performance may lead players to drink more sports drink (rather than the reverse).\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.2: Reverse (Opposite) Direction of Effect From the Hypothesized Effect, Where \\(Y\\) Causes \\(X\\).\n\n\nA third possibility is that the association could reflect the influence of a third variable. If a third variable is a common cause of each and accounts for their association, it is a confound. An observed association between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) could reflect a confound—i.e., a cause (\\(Z\\)) that influences both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\), which explains why \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) are correlated even though they are not causally related. A third variable confound that is a common cause of both \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) is depicted in Figure 6.3. For instance, it may not be that sport drink consumption per se influences player performance; rather, it may be that players who are more intelligent or have more financial resources tend to drink more sports drinks and also tend to perform better. In this case, intelligence or financial resources may be a confound that influences both sports drink consumption and player performance, but sports drink consumptions—though correlated with player performance—does not influence player performance.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.3: Confounded Association Between \\(X\\) and \\(Y\\) due to a Common Cause, \\(Z\\).\n\n\nLastly, the association might be spurious. It might just reflect random variation (i.e., chance), and that when tested on an independent sample, what appeared as an association in the original dataset may not hold when testing the association in a new dataset.\n\n6.3.3 Case Study\nIn a case study, we assess a small sample of individuals (commonly only one person or a few people), often with rich qualitative information. Themes may be coded from the qualitative information, which may help inform inferences about whether some process may have played a role in influencing the outcome of interest. The inferences are then drawn in a subjective, qualitative way. Testimonials and anecdotes are examples are case studies.\nFor instance, to use a case study to evalute the possibilty that players who drink sports drinks perform better than players who drink only water, we could conduct an in-depth interview with a player. In the interview, we might ask the player how they performed in games with versus without a sports drink and have them discuss whether they believe the sports drink improved their performance (and if so, how). Then, based on the player’s responses, we might code the responses to extract themes and to make a qualitative judgement of whether or not the player likely performed better during games in which they had a sports drink.\n\n6.3.4 Other Features of the Research Design\n\n6.3.4.1 Number of Timepoints\nIn addition to whether the research design is an experiment, correlational/observational study, or a case study, a research design can also have one or multiple timepoints. The differing number of timepoints allow studies to be characterized as one of the following:\n\ncross-sectional\nlongitudinal\n\n\n6.3.4.1.1 Cross-Sectional\nA cross-sectional study is a study with one timepoint.\nFor instance, in a cross-sectional study evaluating whether having a sports drink improves player performance, we might assess players’ drinking behavior and performance during only game 1.\nCross-sectional studies are more common than longitudinal studies because cross-sectional studies are less costly and time-consuming. They can provide a helpful starting point to test findings more rigorously in subsequent longitudinal studies.\n\n6.3.4.1.2 Longitudinal Design\nA longitudinal study is a study with more than one timepoint. When the same measures are assessed at each of multiple timepoints, we refer to this as a “repeated measures” design.\nIn a longitudinal study evaluating whether having a sports drink improves player performance, we might assess players’ drinking behavior and performance during each game of the season, and possibly across multiple seasons.\nLongitudinal studies are less common than cross-sectional studies because longitudinal studies are more costly and time-consuming. Nevertheless, longitudinal studies can allow us test our hypotheses more rigorously, because they can allow us to test whether changes in the predictor/indepdnent variable leads to changes in the outcome/dependent variable. Thus, compared to cross-sectional studies, longitudinal studies can provide greater confidence in causal inferences.\n\n6.3.4.2 Within- or Between-Subject\nA research design can also be within-subject, between-subject, or both. A study can involve both within-subject and between-subject comparisons if one predictor/independent variable is within-subject and another predictor/independent variable is between-subject.\n\n6.3.4.2.1 Within-Subject Design\nA within-subject design is one in which each participant (i.e., person or player) receives multiple levels of the independent variable (or predictor).\nFor instance, in an experiment evaluating whether having a sports drink improves player performance, we might assign players to drink the sports drink in the first half of the game and to drink only water in the second half of the game. Or we could assign some of the players to drink sports drink in the first half and water in the second half, and assign the other players to drink water in the first half and sports drink in the second half.\nIn a correlational study evaluating whether having a sports drink improves player performance, we might evaluate how within-person changes in sports drink consumption are associated with within-person changes in performance. That is, we could evaluate, when a given player has a sports drink (or more sports drinks), do they perform better than when the same individual has only water (or fewer sports drinks)?\nWithin-subject designs tend to have greater statistical power than between-subject designs. However, within-subject designs often have carryover effects. For instance, consider the study in which we assign players to drink only water in the first and third quarters and to drink sports drink in the second and fourth quarters (an A-B-A-B design). Drinking sports drink in the second quarter could increase how much hydration a player has throughout the rest of the game, which could lead to altered performance in the third and fourth quarters that is not due to what they drink in third and fourth quarters.\n\n6.3.4.2.2 Between-Subject Design\nA between-subject design is one in which each participant (i.e., person or player) receives only one level of the independent variable.\nFor instance, in an experiment evaluating whether having a sports drink improves player performance, we might assign some players to drink the sports drink but the other players to drink only water.\nIn a correlational study evaluating whether having a sports drink improves player performance, we might evaluate whether people who drink sports drinks tend to perform better than players who drink only water. Or, we could evaluate whether players who drink more sports drinks perform better than players who drink fewer sports drinks (i.e., whether the number of sports drinks consumed during a game is correlated with player performance).",

    "text": "6.4 Research Design Validity\nResearch design validity involves the accuracy of inferences from a study. There are three types of research design validity:\n\ninternal validity\nexternal validity\nconclusion validity\n\n\n6.4.1 Internal Validity\nInternal validity is the extent to which we can be confident that the associations identified in the study are causal.\n\n6.4.2 External Validity\nExternal validity is the extent to which we can be confident that findings from the study play out similarly in the real world—that is, the findings generalize to the target population.\n\n6.4.3 Tradeoffs Between Internal and External Validity\nThere is a tradeoff between internal and external validity—a single research design cannot have both high internal and high external validity. Each study and design has weaknesses. Some research designs are better suited for making causal inferences, whereas other designs tend to be better suited for making inferences that generalize to the real world. The research design that is best suited to making causal inferences is an experiment because it is the design in which the researcher has the greatest control over the variables. Thus, experiments tend to have higher internal validity than other research designs. However, by manipulating one variable and holding everything else constant, the research takes place in a very standardized fashion that can become like studying a process in a vacuum. So, even if a process is theoretically causal in a vacuum, it may act differently in the real world when it interacts with other processes.\nCorrelational designs have greater capacity for external validity than experimental designs because the participants can be observed in their natural environments to evaluate how variables are related in the real world. However, the greater external validity comes at a cost of lower internal validity. Correlational designs are not well-positioned to make causal inferences. Correlational studies can account for potential confounds using covariates or for the reverse direction of effect using longitudinal designs, but the researcher has less control over the variables than in an experiment.\nAs the internal validity of a study’s design increases, its external validity tends to decrease. The greater control we have over variables (and, therefore, have greater confidence about causal inferences), the lower the likelihood that the findings reflect what happens in the real world because it is studying things in a metaphorical vacuum. Because no single research design can have both high internal and external validity, scientific inquiry needs a combination of many different research designs so we can be more confident in our inferences—experimental designs for making causal inferences and correlational designs for making inferences that are more likely to reflect the real world.\nCase studies, because they have smaller sample sizes and inferences drawn in a subjective, qualitative way, tend to have lower external validity than both experimental and correlational studies. Case studies also tend to have lower internal validity because they have less control over variables, and thus fail to remove the possibility of illusory correlations, potential confounds, or the reverse direction of effect. Thus, case studies are among the weakest forms of evidence. Nevertheless, case studies can still be useful for generating hypotheses that can then be tested empirically with a larger sample in experimental or correlational studies.\n\n6.4.4 Conclusion Validity\nConclusion validity is the extent to which a study’s conclusions are reasonable about the association among variables based on the data. That is, were the correct statistical analyses performed, and are the interpretations of the findings from those analyses correct?",

    "text": "6.5 Mediation vs Moderation\nBoth types of effects involve (at least) three variables:\n\nAn independent/predictor variable, which will be labeled as X.\nA dependent/outcome variable, which will be labeled as Y.\nThe mediator or moderator variable, which will be labeled as M.\n\nA mnemonic to help remember the difference between mediation and moderation is in Figure 6.4.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.4: Mediation Versus Moderation Mnemonic.\n\n\n\n6.5.1 Mediation\n\n6.5.1.1 Overview\nMediation is a causal chain of events, where one variable (a mediator variable) at least partially explains (or accounts for) the association between two other variables (the predictor variable and the outcome variable). In mediation, a predictor (X) leads to a mediator (M), which leads to an outcome (Y). Mediation answers the question of, “Why (or how) does X influence Y? A mediator (M) is a variable that helps explain the assocation between two other variables, and it answers the question of why/how X influences Y. That is, the mediator is the variable that helps explain how/why X is related to Y. In other words, you can think of the mediator as the mechanism that helps explain why X has an impact on Y. The association between X and Y gets smaller when accounting for M. Visually this can be written as in Figure 6.5:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.5: Mediation.\n\n\nwhere X is causing M, which in turn is causing Y. In other words, X leads to M, and M leads to Y.\nFor instance, if we determine that consuming sports drinks improves player performance, we may want to know how/why. That is, what is the mechanism that leads consumption of sports drinks to improve player performance? We might hypothesize that consumption of sports drink helps increase a player’s hydration, which in turn will improve the player’s performance. In this case, increased hydration mediates (i.e., helps explain or account for) the effect of the sports drink consumption on improved player performance.\nQuestion: Why/how does sports drink consumpion lead players to perform better?\nAnswer: increased hydration\nAs a picture, we can draw this assocation as in Figure 6.6:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.6: Mediation Example.\n\n\n\n6.5.1.2 Types of Mediation\n\n6.5.1.2.1 Full Mediation\nWhen one mechanism fully accounts for the effect of the predictor variable on the outcome variable, this is known as full mediation, as depicted in Figure 6.7:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.7: Full Mediation.\n\n\n\n6.5.1.2.2 Partial Mediation\nWhen a single process partially—but does not fully—accounts for the effect of the predictor variable on the outcome variable; this is known as partial mediation and is depicted in Figure 6.8:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.8: Partial Mediation.\n\n\n\n6.5.1.2.3 Multiple Mediators\nIn addition, there can be multiple mediators/mechanisms that account for the effect of a predictor variable on an outcome variable, as depicted in Figure 6.9:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.9: Multiple Mediators.\n\n\n\n6.5.2 Moderation (i.e., Interaction)\n\n6.5.2.1 Overview\nModeration (sometimes called an “interaction”), on the other hand, occurs when there is a variable or condition (M; called a “moderator”) that changes the assocation between X and Y. That is, the effect of the predictor variable on the outcome variable differs at different levels of the moderator variable. In these cases, X and M work together to have an effect on Y; here X does not have a direct effect on M. Moderation answers the question of, “For whom does X influence Y?” If X influences Y more strongly for some people or in some circumstances, we would say that there is an interaction such that the effect of X on Y depends on M, as depicted in Figure 6.10:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.10: Moderation.\n\n\nFor example, if the effect of consuming sports drinks on player performance differs for Quarterbacks and Wide Receivers, the interaction could be depicted in Figure 6.11 and Figure 6.12:\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.11: Moderation Example: Path Diagram.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.12: Moderation Example: Interaction Graph.\n\n\nAn interaction can be identified visually by non-parallel lines at different levels of the moderator. In this example, the player’s position moderates the effect consuming sports drinks on player performance. In particular, there is a strong positive association between consuming sports drinks and player performance for Wide Receivers (as evidenced by the upward slope of the best-fit regression line), whereas there is no association between consuming sports drinks and player performance for Quarterbacks (as evidenced by the flat line).",

    "section": "\n6.6 Levels of Measurement",
    "text": "6.6 Levels of Measurement\nIt is important to know the levels of measurement of your data, because the level(s) of measurement of your data constrain the types of comparisons and analyses that you can meaningfully perform. There are four levels of measurement that any variable can have:\n\nnominal\nordinal\ninterval\nratio\n\nEach is described below:\n\n6.6.1 Nominal\nA variable is considered nominal if it is composed of qualitative classifications. You cannot meaningfully evaluate whether one number in the variable is larger than another number in the variable because higher numbers do not reflect higher levels of the concept. Examples of nominal variables include:\n\nsex (e.g., 1 = male; 2 = female)\nrace (e.g., 1 = American Indian; 2 = Asian; 3 = Black; 4 = Pacific Islander; 5 = White)\nethnicity (e.g., 0 = Non-Hispanic/Latino; 1 = Hispanic/Latino)\nzip code\njersey number\n\nA football player’s jersey number is an example of a nominal variable. A jersey number of 7 is not higher on whatever concept of interest compared to a jersey number of 6.\nTo examine the central tendency of a nominal variable, you can determine the mode, but you cannot calculate a mean or median.\n\n6.6.2 Ordinal\nA variable is considered ordinal if the classifications are ordered. However, ordinal variables do not have equally spaced intervals. Examples of ordinal intervals include:\n\nlikert response scales (e.g., 1 = strongly disagree; 2 = disagree; 3 = neutral; 4 = agree; 5 = strongly agree)\neducational attainment (e.g., 1 = no formal education; 2 = elementary school; 3 = middle school; 4 = high school; 5 = college; 6 = graduate degree)\nacademic grades on A–F scale (e.g., 1 = A; 2 = B; 3 = C; 4 = D; 5 = F)\nplayer rank (1 = 1st; 2 = 2nd; 3 = 3rd, etc.)\n\nA football player’s fantasy rank is an example of an ordinal variable. A player with a fantasy rank of 1 has a higher rank than a player with a rank of 2, but it is not known how far apart each player is—i.e., the intervals do not all reflect the same distance. For instance, the distance between the top-ranked player and the 2nd-best player might be 30 points, whereas the distance between the 2nd-best player and the 3rd-best player might be 2 points.\nTo examine the central tendency of ordinal data, the median and mode are most appropriate; however, the mean may be used (unlike for nominal data).\n\n6.6.3 Interval\nA variable is considered interval if the classifications are ordered (similar to ordinal data) and have equally spaced intervals (unlike ordinal data). However, interval variables do not have a meaningful zero that reflects absence. Examples of interval data include:\n\ntemperature on the Fahrenheit or Celsius scale\ntime of day\n\nFor instance, the temperature difference between 80 and 90 degrees Fahrenheit is the same as the temperature difference between 90 and 100 degrees Fahrenheit. However, 0 degrees Fahrenheit does not reflect absence of temperature/heat.\nInterval data can be meaningfully added or subtracted. For instance, if a game starts at 4 pm and ends at 7 pm, you know the game lasted 3 hours (\\(7 - 4 = 3\\)). However, interval data cannot be meaningfully multiplied or divided. For instance, 100 degrees Fahrenheit is not twice as hot as 50 degrees Fahrenheit.\nTo examine the central tendency of interval data, you can compute the mean, median, or mode.\n\n6.6.4 Ratio\nA variable is considered ratio if the classifications are ordered (similar to ordinal data), have equally spaced intervals (like interval data), and have an absolute zero point that reflects absence of the concept. Examples of ratio data include:\n\ntemperature on the Kelvin scale\nheight\nweight\nage\ndistance\nspeed\nvolume\ntime elapsed\nincome\nyears of formal education\npoints in football\n\nFor instance, points in football has order, equally spaced intervals, and an absolute zero—a team cannot score less than zero points, and zero points reflects absence of points (though it could be argued to be interval data because zero points does not reflect absence of skill.)\nRatio data can be meaningfully added, subtracted, multiplied, or divided. A player who weighs 350 pounds weighs twice as much as someone who weighs 175 pounds.\nTo examine the central tendency of ratio data, you can compute the mean, median, or mode.",

    "section": "\n6.7 Psychometrics",
    "text": "6.7 Psychometrics\nBelow, I provide brief discussions of various aspects of measurement reliability and validity. For more information on these and other aspects of psychometrics, see Petersen (2024a) and Petersen (2024b).\n\n6.7.1 Measurement Reliability\nThe reliability of a measure’s scores deals with the consistency of measurement. This book focuses on the following types of reliability:\n\ntest–retest reliability\ninter-rater reliability\nintra-rater reliability\ninternal consistency\nparallel-forms reliability\n\nFor more information on these and other aspects of reliability, see https://isaactpetersen.github.io/Principles-Psychological-Assessment/reliability.html (Petersen, 2024a, 2024b).\n\n6.7.1.1 Test–Retest Reliability\nTest–retest reliability evaluates the consistency of scores across time. For a construct that is expected to be stable across time (e.g., hand size in adults), we would expect our measurements to be consistent across time. The consistency of scores across time can be examined in terms of relative or absolute test–retest reliability. Relative test–retest reliability—i.e., the consistency of individual differences across time—is commonly evaluated using the coefficient of stability (i.e., the Pearson correlation coefficent). Absolute test–retest reliability—i.e., the absolute consistency of people’s scores across time—is commonly evaluated using the coefficient of repeatability.\n\n6.7.1.2 Inter-Rater Reliability\nInter-rater reliability evaluates the consistency of scores across raters. For instance, if we have a strong measure for assessing college players’ aptitude to succeed in the NFL, the measure should yield a similar score for a given player regardless of which (trained) rater (e.g., coach or talent scout) uses it to rate the player. The consistency of scores across raters is commonly evaluated using the intraclass correlation coefficient (for continuous variables) and Cohen’s kappa (\\(\\kappa\\); for categorical variables).\n\n6.7.1.3 Intra-Rater Reliability\nIntra-rater reliability evaluates the consistency of scores within a given rater. If we have a strong measure for assessing college players’ aptitude to succeed in the NFL, the measure should yield a similar score for a given player from the same (trained) rater (e.g., coach or talent scout) each time they rate the same player (assuming the player’s aptitude has not changed). The consistency of scores within raters can be evaluated using similar approaches as those evaluating inter-rater reliability.\n\n6.7.1.4 Internal Consistency\nInternal consistency evaluates the consistency of scores across items within a measure. If we develop a strong questionnaire measure to assess a college players’ aptitude to succeed in the NFL, the scores should be relatively consistent across items. The consistency of scores across items within a measure is commonly evaluated using Cronbach’s alpha (\\(\\alpha\\)) or McDonald’s omega (\\(\\omega\\)).\n\n6.7.1.5 Parallel-Forms Reliability\nParallel-forms reliability evaluates the consistency of scores across different but equivalent forms of a measure. If we develop two equivalent versions of the Wonderlic Contemporary Cognitive Ability Test (Form A and Form B) so that players sitting next to each other do not receive the same items, we would expect a player’s score on Form A would be similar to their score on Form B. Parallel-forms reliability is is commonly evaluated using the coefficient of equivalence (i.e., the Pearson correlation coefficent).\n\n6.7.2 Measurement Validity\nThe validity of a measure’s scores deals with the accuracy of measurement. This book focuses on the following types of validity:\n\nface validity\ncontent validity\n\ncriterion-related validity\n\nconcurrent (criterion-related) validity\npredictive (criterion-related) validity\n\n\nconstruct validity\nconvergent validity\ndiscriminant validity\nincremental validity\n\nFor more information on these and other aspects of validity, see https://isaactpetersen.github.io/Principles-Psychological-Assessment/validity.html (Petersen, 2024a, 2024b).\n\n6.7.2.1 Face Validity\nFace validity evaluates the extent to which a measure “looks like” (on its face) it assesses the construct of interest. For instance, if a measure is developed to assess aptitude of Wide Receivers for the position, it would be considered to have face validity if everyday (lay) people believe that it assesses aptitude for being a successful Wide Receiver.\n\n6.7.2.2 Content Validity\nContent validity evaluates the extent to which the measure assesses the full breadth of the content, as determined by context experts. For the measure to have content validity, it should not have gaps (missing content facets) or intrusions (facets of other constructs). For instance, a strong measure for assessing a player’s aptitude to succeed in the NFL might need to include a player’s speed, strength, size, lateral quickness, etc. If the measure is missing their speed, this would be a content gap. If the measure assesses a construct-irrelevant facet (e.g., their attractiveness), this would be a content intrusion.\n\n6.7.2.3 Criterion-Related Validity\nCriterion-related validity evaluates the extent to which the measure’s scores are related to meaningful variables of interest. Criterion-related validity is commonly evaluated using a Pearson correlation or some form of regression.\nThere are two types of criterion-related validity:\n\nconcurrent (criterion-related) validity\npredictive (criterion-related) validity\n\n\n6.7.2.3.1 Concurrent (Criterion-Related) Validity\nConcurrent criterion-related validity evaluates the extent to which the measure’s scores are related to meaningful variables of interest assessed at the same point in time. That is, concurrent validity could evaluate whether current player statistics (e.g., passing yards) are associated with their fantasy points.\n\n6.7.2.3.2 Predictive (Criterion-Related) Validity\nPredictive criterion-related validity evaluates the extent to which the measure’s scores are related to meaningful variables of interest that are assessed at a later point in time. For example, predictive validity could evaluate whether scores on the measure we developed to assess a player’s aptitude to succeed in the NFL predicts later performance in the NFL.\n\n6.7.2.4 Construct Validity\nConstruct validity evaluates the extent to which the measure’s scores accurately assess the construct of interest. If we develop a measure with intent to assess aptitude for being a successful Running Back, and it appears to more accurately assess aptitude for being a successful Wide Receiver, then our measure has poor construct validity for assessing aptitude for being a successful Running Back. Construct validity subsumes convergent and discriminant validity, in addition to all of the other forms of measurement validity.\n\n6.7.2.5 Convergent Validity\nConvergent validity evaluates the extent to which the measure’s scores are related to other measures of the same construct. For instance, if we develop a new measure to assess intelligence, its scores should be related to scores from other measures designed to assess intelligence (e.g., Wonderlic Contemporary Cognitive Ability Test).\n\n6.7.2.6 Discriminant Validity\nDiscriminant validity evaluates the extent to which the measure’s scores are unrelated to measures of the different constructs. For instance, if we develop a new measure to assess intelligence, its scores should be less strongly associated with measures of other constructs (e.g., measures of happiness).\n\n6.7.2.7 Incremental Validity\nIncremental validity evalutes the extent to which the measure’s scores provide an increase in predictive accuracy compared to other information that is easily and cheaply available. That is, in order to be useful, a strong measure should tell us something that we did not already know. For instance, if we develop a strong measure of intelligence, it should result in increased predictive accuracy (for success in the NFL) compared to when just relying on the Wonderlic Contemporary Cognitive Ability Test.\n\n6.7.3 Reliability vs Validity\nReliability and validity are different but related. Reliability refers to the consistency of scores, whereas accuracy refers to the accuracy of scores. Validity depends on reliability. Reliability is necessary—but insufficient for—validity. That is, consistency is necessary—but insufficient for—accuracy. As depicted in Figure 6.13, a measure can be no more valid than it is reliable. A measure can be consistent but inaccurate; however, a measure cannot be accurate but inconsistent.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 6.13: Reliability Versus Validity.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCorston, R., & Colman, A. M.

    "section": "\n7.3 Inferential Statistics",
    "text": "7.3 Inferential Statistics\nInferential statistics are used to draw inferences regarding whether there is (a) a difference in level on variable across groups or (b) an association between variables. For instance, inferential statistics may be used to evaluate whether Quarterbacks tend to have longer careers compared to Running Backs. Or, they could be used to evaluate whether number of carries is associated with injury likelihood. To apply inferential statistics, we make use of the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) and the alternative hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)).\n\n7.3.1 Null Hypothesis Significance Testing\n\n7.3.1.1 Null Hypothesis (\\(H_0\\))\nWhen testing whether there are differences in level across groups on a variable of interest, the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) is that there is no difference in level across groups. For instance, when testing whether Quarterbacks tend to have longer careers compared to Running Backs, the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) is that Quarterbacks do not systematically differ from Running Backs in the length of their career.\nWhen testing whether there is an association between variables, the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) is that there is no association between the variables. For instance, when testing whether number of carries is associated with injury likelihood, the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) is that there is no association between number of carries and injury likelihood.\n\n7.3.1.2 Alternative Hypothesis (\\(H_1\\))\nThe alternative hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)) is the researcher’s hypothesis that they want to evaluate. An alternative hypothesis (\\(H_1\\)) might be directional (i.e., one-sided) or non-directional (i.e., two-sided).\nDirectional hypotheses specify a particular direction, such as which group will have larger scores or which direction (positive or negative) two variables will be associated. Examples of directional hypotheses include:\n\nQuarterbacks have longer careers compared to Running Backs\nNumber of carries is positively associated with injury likelihood\n\nNon-directional hypotheses do not specify a particular direction. For instance, non-directional hypotheses may state that two groups differ but do not specify which group will have larger scores. Or, non-directional hypotheses may state that two variables are associated but do not state what the sign is of the association—i.e., positive or negative. Examples of non-directional hypotheses include:\n\nQuarterbacks differ in the length of their careers compared to Running Backs\nNumber of carries is associated with injury likelihood\n\n7.3.1.3 Statistical Significance\nIn science, statistical significance is evaluated with the p-value. The p-value does not represent the probability that you observed the result by chance. The p-value represents a conditional probability—it examines the probability of one event given another event. In particular, the p-value evaluates the likelihood that you would detect a result as at least as extreme as the one observed (in terms of the magnitude of the difference or of the association) given that the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) is true.\nThis can be expressed in conditional probability notation, \\(Pr(A | B)\\), which is the probability (likelihood) of event A occurring given that event B occurred (or given condition B).\nThe conditional probability notation for a left-tailed directional test (i.e., Quarterbacks have shorter careers than Running Backs; or number of carries is negatively associated with injury likelihood) is in Equation 7.6.\n\\[\np\\text{-value} = Pr(T \\le t | H_0)\n\\tag{7.6}\\]\nwhere \\(T\\) is the test statistic of interest (e.g., the distribution of \\(t\\)-, \\(r-\\), or \\(F\\) values, depending on the test) and \\(t\\) is the observed test statistic (e.g., \\(t\\)-, \\(r-\\), or \\(F\\)-coefficient, depending on the test).\nThe conditional probability notation for a right-tailed directional test (i.e., Quarterbacks have longer careers than Running Backs; or number of carries is positively associated with injury likelihood) is in Equation 7.7.\n\\[\np\\text{-value} = Pr(T \\ge t | H_0)\n\\tag{7.7}\\]\nThe conditional probability notation for a two-tailed non-directional test (i.e., Quarterbacks differ in the length of their careers compared to Running Backs; or number of carries is associated with injury likelihood) is in Equation 7.8.\n\\[\np\\text{-value} = 2 \\times \\text{min}(Pr(T \\le t | H_0), Pr(T \\ge t | H_0))\n\\tag{7.8}\\]\nwhere min(a, b) is the smaller number of a and b.\nIf the distribution of the test statistic is symmetric around zero, the p-value for the two-tailed non-directional test simplifies to Equation 7.9.\n\\[\np\\text{-value} = 2 \\times Pr(T \\ge |t| | H_0)\n\\tag{7.9}\\]\nNevertheless, to be conservative (i.e., to avoid false positive/Type I errors), many researchers use two-tailed p-values regardless whether their hypothesis is one- or two-tailed.\nFor a test of group differences, the p-value evaluates the likelihood that you would observe a difference as large or larger than the one you observed between the groups if there were no systematic difference between the groups. For instance, when evaluating whether Quarterbacks have longer careers than Running Backs, and you observed a mean difference of 0.03 years, the p-value evaluates the likelihood that you would observe a difference as larger or larger than 0.03 years between the groups if Quarterbacks do not differ from Running Backs in terms of the length of their career.\nFor a test of whether two variables are associated, the p-value evaluates the likelihood that you would observe an association as strong or stronger than the one you observed between the groups if there were no association between the variables. For instance, when evaluating whether number of carries is positively associated with injury likelihood, and you observed a correlation coefficient of \\(r = .25\\) between number of carries and injury likelihood, the p-value evaluates the likelihood that you would observe a correlation as strong or stronger than \\(r = .25\\) between the variables if number of carries is not associated with injury likelihood.\nUsing what is called null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we consider an effect to be statistically significant if the p-value is less than some threshold, called the alpha level. In science, we typically want to be conservative because a false positive (i.e., Type I error) is considered more problematic than a false negative (i.e., Type II error). That is, we would rather say an effect does not exist when it really does than to say an effect does exist when it really does not. Thus, we typically set the alpha level to a low value, commonly .05. Then, we would consider an effect to be statistically significant if the p-value is less than .05. That is, there is a small chance (5%; or 1 in 20 times) that we would observe an effect at least as extreme as the effect observed, if the null hypothesis were true. So, you might expect around 5% of tests where the null hypothesis is true to be statistically significant just by chance. We could lower the rate of Type II (i.e., false negative) errors—i.e., we could detect more effects—if we set the alpha level to a higher value (e.g., .10); however, raising the alpha level would raise the possibility of Type I (false positive) errors.\nIf the p-value is less than .05, we reject the null hypothesis (\\(H_0\\)) that there was no difference or association. Thus, we conclude that there was a statistically significant (non-zero) difference or association. If the p-value is greater than .05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis; the difference/association was not statistically significant. Thus, we do not have confidence that there was a difference or association. However, we do not accept the null hypothesis; it could be there we did not observe an effect because we did not have adequate power to detect the effect—e.g., if the effect size was small, the data were noisy, and the sample size was small and/or unrepresentative.\nThere are four general possibilities of decision making outcomes when performing null-hypothesis significance testing:\n\nWe (correctly) reject the null hypothesis when it is in fact false (\\(1 - \\beta\\)). This is a true positive. For instance, we may correctly determine that Quarterbacks have longer careers than Running Backs.\nWe (correctly) fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is in fact true (\\(1 - \\alpha\\)). This is a true negative. For instance, we may correctly determine that Quarterbacks do not have longer careers than Running Backs.\nWe (incorrectly) reject the null hypothesis when it is in fact true (\\(\\alpha\\)). This is a false positive. When performing null hypothesis testing, a false positive is known as a Type I error. For instance, we may incorrectly determine that Quarterbacks have longer careers than Running Backs when, in fact, Quarterbacks and Running Backs do not differ in their career length.\nWe (incorrectly) fail to reject the null hypothesis when it is in fact false (\\(\\beta\\)). This is a false negative. When performing null hypothesis testing, a false negative is known as a Type II error. For instance, we may incorrectly determine that Quarterbacks and Running Backs do not differ in their career length when, in fact, Quarterbacks have longer careers than Running Backs.\n\nA two-by-two confusion matrix for null-hypothesis significance testing is in Figure 7.1.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.1: A Two-by-Two Confusion Matrix for Null-Hypothesis Significance Testing.\n\n\nIn statistics, power is the probability of detecting an effect, if, in fact, the effect exists. Otherwise said, power is the probability of rejecting the null hypothesis, if, in fact, the null hypothesis is false. Power is influenced by several variables:\n\nthe sample size (N): the larger the N, the greater the power\n\nfor group comparisons, the power depends on the sample size of each group\n\n\nthe effect size: the larger the effect, the greater the power\n\nfor group comparisons, larger effect sizes reflect:\n\nlarger between-group variance, and\nsmaller within-group variance (i.e., strong measurement precision, i.e., reliability)\n\n\n\n\nthe alpha level: the researcher specifies the alpha level (though it is typically set at .05); the higher the alpha level, the greater the power; however, the higher we set the alpha level, the higher the likelihood of Type I errors (false positives)\none- versus two-tailed tests: one-tailed tests have higher power than two-tailed tests\n\nwithin-subject versus between-subject comparisons: within-subject designs tend to have greater power than between-subject designs\n\n\nA plot of statistical power is in Figure 7.2.\n\nCodem1 &lt;- 0  # mu H0\nsd1 &lt;- 1.5 # sigma H0\nm2 &lt;- 3.5 # mu HA\nsd2 &lt;- 1.5 # sigma HA\n \nz_crit &lt;- qnorm(1-(0.05/2), m1, sd1)\n \n# set length of tails\nmin1 &lt;- m1-sd1*4\nmax1 &lt;- m1+sd1*4\nmin2 &lt;- m2-sd2*4\nmax2 &lt;- m2+sd2*4          \n# create x sequence\nx &lt;- seq(min(min1,min2), max(max1, max2), .01)\n# generate normal dist #1\ny1 &lt;- dnorm(x, m1, sd1)\n# put in data frame\ndf1 &lt;- data.frame(\"x\" = x, \"y\" = y1)\n# generate normal dist #2\ny2 &lt;- dnorm(x, m2, sd2)\n# put in data frame\ndf2 &lt;- data.frame(\"x\" = x, \"y\" = y2)\n \n# Alpha polygon\ny.poly &lt;- pmin(y1,y2)\npoly1 &lt;- data.frame(x=x, y=y.poly)\npoly1 &lt;- poly1[poly1$x &gt;= z_crit, ] \npoly1&lt;-rbind(poly1, c(z_crit, 0))  # add lower-left corner\n \n# Beta polygon\npoly2 &lt;- df2\npoly2 &lt;- poly2[poly2$x &lt;= z_crit,] \npoly2&lt;-rbind(poly2, c(z_crit, 0))  # add lower-left corner\n \n# power polygon; 1-beta\npoly3 &lt;- df2\npoly3 &lt;- poly3[poly3$x &gt;= z_crit,] \npoly3 &lt;-rbind(poly3, c(z_crit, 0))  # add lower-left corner\n \n# combine polygons. \npoly1$id &lt;- 3 # alpha, give it the highest number to make it the top layer\npoly2$id &lt;- 2 # beta\npoly3$id &lt;- 1 # power; 1 - beta\npoly &lt;- rbind(poly1, poly2, poly3)\npoly$id &lt;- factor(poly$id,  labels=c(\"power\",\"beta\",\"alpha\"))\n\n# plot with ggplot2\nggplot(poly, aes(x,y, fill=id, group=id)) +\n  geom_polygon(show.legend=F, alpha=I(8/10)) +\n  # add line for treatment group\n  geom_line(data=df1, aes(x,y, color=\"H0\", group=NULL, fill=NULL), linewidth=1.5, show_guide=F) + \n  # add line for treatment group.

However, just because something is statistically significant does not mean that it is important. In addition to statistical significance, it is also important to consider practical significance.\n\n7.3.2 Practical Significance\nPractical significance deals with how large or important the effect/association/difference is. It is based on the magnitude of the effect, called the effect size. Effect size can be quantified in various ways including:\n\nCohen’s \\(d\\)\n\nStandardized regression coefficient (beta; \\(\\beta\\))\nCorrelation coefficient (\\(r\\))\nCohen’s \\(\\omega\\) (omega)\nCohen’s \\(f\\)\n\nCohen’s \\(f^2\\)\n\nCoefficient of determination (\\(R^2\\))\nEta squared (\\(\\eta^2\\))\nPartial eta squared (\\(\\eta_p^2\\))\n\n\n7.3.2.1 Cohen’s \\(d\\)\n\nCohen’s \\(d\\) is calculated as in Equation 7.10:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n  d &= \\frac{\\text{mean difference}}{\\text{pooled standard deviation}} \\\\\n   &= \\frac{X_1 - X_2}{s} \\\\\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{7.10}\\]\nwhere:\n\\[\ns = \\sqrt{\\frac{(n_1 - 1)s_1^2 + (n_2 - 1)s_2^2}{n_1 + n_2 - 2}}\n\\tag{7.11}\\]\nwhere \\(n_1\\) and \\(n_2\\) is the sample size of group 1 and group 2, respectively, and \\(s_1\\) and \\(s_2\\) is the standard deviation of group 1 and group 2, respectively.\n\n7.3.2.2 Standardized Regression Coefficient (Beta; \\(\\beta\\))\nThe standardized regression coefficient (beta; \\(\\beta\\)) is used in multiple regression, and is calculated as in Equation 7.12:\n\\[\n\\beta_x = B_x \\times \\frac{s_x}{s_y}\n\\tag{7.12}\\]\nwhere \\(B_x\\) is the unstandardized regression coefficient of the predictor variable \\(x\\) in predicting the outcome variable \\(y\\), \\(s_x\\) is the standard deviation of \\(x\\), and \\(s_y\\) is the standard deviation of \\(y\\).\n\n7.3.2.3 Correlation Coefficient (\\(r\\))\nThe formula for the correlation coefficient is in Section 7.5.3.\n\n7.3.2.4 Cohen’s \\(\\omega\\)\n\nCohen’s \\(\\omega\\) is used in chi-square tests, and is calculated as in Equation 7.13:\n\\[\n\\omega = \\sqrt{\\frac{\\chi^2}{N} - \\frac{df}{N}}\n\\tag{7.13}\\]\nwhere \\(\\chi^2\\) is the chi-square statistic from the test, \\(N\\) is the sample size, and \\(df\\) is the degrees of freedom.\n\n7.3.2.5 Cohen’s \\(f\\)\n\nCohen’s \\(f\\) is commonly used in ANOVA, and is calculated as in Equation 7.14:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n  f &= \\sqrt{\\frac{R^2}{1 - R^2}} \\\\\n    &= \\sqrt{\\frac{\\eta^2}{1 - \\eta^2}}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{7.14}\\]\n\n7.3.2.6 Cohen’s \\(f^2\\)\n\nCohen’s \\(f^2\\) is commonly used in regression, and is calculated as in Equation 7.15:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n  f^2 &= \\frac{R^2}{1 - R^2} \\\\\n      &= \\frac{\\eta^2}{1 - \\eta^2}\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{7.15}\\]\n\n7.3.2.7 Coefficient of Determination (\\(R^2\\))\nThe coefficient of determination (\\(R^2\\)) reflects the proportion of variance in the outcome variable that is explained by the predictor variable(s). \\(R^2\\) is commonly used in regression, and is calculated as in Equation 7.16:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n  R^2 &= 1 - \\frac{\\sum (Y_i - \\hat{Y}_i)^2}{\\sum (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2} \\\\\n      &= 1 - \\frac{SS_{\\text{residual}}}{SS_{\\text{total}}} \\\\\n      &= 1 - \\frac{\\text{sum of squared residuals}}{\\text{total sum of squares}} \\\\\n      &= \\frac{f^2}{1 + f^2} \\\\\n      &= \\eta^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{7.16}\\]\nwhere \\(Y_i\\) is the observed value of the outcome variable for the \\(i\\)th observation, \\(\\hat{Y}_i\\) is the model predicted value for the \\(i\\)th observation, \\(\\bar{Y}\\) is the mean of the observed values of the outcome variable. The total sum of squares is an index of the total variation in the outcome variable.\n\n7.3.2.8 Eta Squared (\\(\\eta^2\\)) and Partial Eta Squared (\\(\\eta_p^2\\))\nLike \\(R^2\\), eta squared (\\(\\eta^2\\)) reflects the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable(s). \\(\\eta^2\\) is commonly used in ANOVA, and is calculated as in Equation 7.17:\n\\[\n\\begin{aligned}\n  \\eta^2 &= \\frac{SS_{\\text{effect}}}{SS_{\\text{total}}} \\\\\n      &= 1 - \\frac{SS_{\\text{residual}}}{SS_{\\text{total}}} \\\\\n      &= 1 - \\frac{\\text{sum of squared residuals}}{\\text{total sum of squares}} \\\\\n      &= \\frac{f^2}{1 + f^2} \\\\\n      &= R^2\n\\end{aligned}\n\\tag{7.17}\\]\nwhere \\(SS_{\\text{effect}}\\) is the sum of squares for the effect of interest and SS_{} is the total sum of squares.\nPartial eta squared (\\(\\eta_p^2\\)) reflects the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variable while controlling for the other independent variables. \\(\\eta_p^2\\) is commonly used in ANOVA, and is calculated as in Equation 7.18:\n\\[\n\\eta_p^2 = = \\frac{SS_{\\text{effect}}}{SS_{\\text{effect}} + SS_{\\text{error}}}\n\\tag{7.18}\\]\nwhere \\(SS_{\\text{effect}}\\) is the sum of squares for the effect of interest and SS_{} is the sum of squares for the residual error term.\n\n7.3.2.9 Effect Size Thresholds\nEffect size thresholds (McGrath & Meyer, 2006) for small, medium, and large effect sizes are in Table 7.2.\n\n\nTable 7.2: Effect Size Thresholds for Small, Medium, and Large Effect Sizes.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nEffect Size Index\nSmall\nMedium\nLarge\n\n\n\nCohen’s \\(d\\)\n\n\\(\\ge |.20|\\)\n\\(\\ge |.50|\\)\n\\(\\ge |.80|\\)\n\n\nStandardized regression coefficient (beta; \\(\\beta\\))\n\\(\\ge |.10|\\)\n\\(\\ge |.24|\\)\n\\(\\ge |.37|\\)\n\n\nCorrelation coefficient (\\(r\\))\n\\(\\ge |.10|\\)\n\\(\\ge |.24|\\)\n\\(\\ge |.37|\\)\n\n\nCohen’s \\(\\omega\\)\n\n\\(\\ge .10\\)\n\\(\\ge .30\\)\n\\(\\ge .50\\)\n\n\nCohen’s \\(f\\)\n\n\\(\\ge .10\\)\n\\(\\ge .25\\)\n\\(\\ge .40\\)\n\n\nCohen’s \\(f^2\\)\n\n\\(\\ge .01\\)\n\\(\\ge .06\\)\n\\(\\ge .16\\)\n\n\nCoefficient of determination (\\(R^2\\))\n\\(\\ge .01\\)\n\\(\\ge .06\\)\n\\(\\ge .14\\)\n\n\nEta squared (\\(\\eta^2\\))\n\\(\\ge .01\\)\n\\(\\ge .06\\)\n\\(\\ge .14\\)\n\n\nPartial eta squared (\\(\\eta_p^2\\))\n\\(\\ge .01\\)\n\\(\\ge .06\\)\n\\(\\ge .14\\)",

    "text": "7.5 Statistical Tests\n\n7.5.1 t-Test\nThere are several t-tests:\n\none-sample t-test\ntwo-samples t-test\n\nindependent samples t-test\npaired samples t-test\n\n\n\nA one-sample t-test is used to evaluate whether a sample mean differs systematically from a particular value. The null hypothesis is that the sample mean does not differ systematically from the pre-specified value. The alternative hypothesis is that the sample mean differs systematically from the pre-specified value. For instance, let’s say you want to test out a new draft strategy. You could participate in a mock draft and draft players using the new strategy. Then, you could use a one-sample t-test to evaluate whether your new draft strategy yields players with more projected points than the average of players’ projected points for other teams.\nTwo-samples t-tests are used to test for differences between scores of two groups. If the two groups are independent, the independent samples t-test is used. If the two groups involve paired samples, the paired samples t-test is used. The null hypothesis is that the mean of group 1 does not differ systematically from the mean of group 2. The alternative hypothesis is that the mean of group 1 differs systematically from the mean of group 2. For instance, you could use an independent-samples t-test if you want to examine whether Quarterbacks tend to have have longer careers than Running Backs. By contrast, you could use a paired samples t-test if you want to examine whether Quarterbacks tend to score more points in the second year of their contract compared to their rookie year, because the same subjects were assessed twice (i.e., a within-subject design).\n\n7.5.2 Analysis of Variance\nAnalysis of variance (ANOVA) allows examining whether groups differ systematically as a function of one or more factors. There are multiple variants of ANOVA:\n\none-way ANOVA\nfactorial ANOVA\nrepeated measures ANOVA (RM-ANOVA)\nmultivariate ANOVA (MANOVA)\n\nLike two-samples t-tests, ANOVA allows examining whether groups differ as a function of an independent variable. However, unlike a t-test, ANOVA allows examining multiple multiple independent variables and more than two groups. The null hypothesis is that the the groups’ mean value does not differ systematically. The alternative hypothesis is that the groups’ mean value differs systematically.\nA one-way ANOVA examines whether two or more groups differ as a function of an independent variable. For instance, you could use a one-way ANOVA to evaluate if you want to evaluate whether multiple positions differ in their length of career. Factorial ANOVA examines whether two or more groups differ as a function of multiple independent variables. For instance, you could use factorial ANOVA to evaluate whether one’s length of career depends on one’s position and weight. Repeated measures ANOVA examines whether scores differ across repeated measures (e.g., across time) for the same participants. For instance, you could use repeated-measures ANOVA to evaluate whether rookies score more points as the season progresses. Multivariate ANOVA examines whether multiple dependent variables differ as a function of one or more factor(s). For instance, you could use MANOVA to evaluate whether one’s contract length and pay differ as a function of one’s position.\n\n7.5.3 Correlation\nCorrelation examines the association between a predictor and outcome variable. The null hypothesis is that the the two variables are not associated. The alternative hypothesis is that the two variables are associated.\nThe Pearson correlation coefficient (\\(r\\)) is calculated as in Equation 7.19:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\sum (X_i - \\bar{X})(Y_i - \\bar{Y})}{\\sqrt{\\sum (X_i - \\bar{X})^2 \\sum (Y_i - \\bar{Y})^2}}\n\\tag{7.19}\\]\nwhere \\(X\\) is the predictor variable and \\(Y\\) is the outcome variable.\n\n7.5.4 (Multiple) Regression\nRegression, like correlation, examines the association between a predictor and outcome variable. However, unlike correlation, regression allows multiple predictor variables.\nRegression with one predictor takes the form of Equation 7.20:\n\\[\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\epsilon\n\\tag{7.20}\\]\nwhere \\(y\\) is the outcome variable, \\(\\beta_0\\) is the intercept, \\(\\beta_1\\) is the slope, \\(x_1\\) is the predictor variable, and \\(\\epsilon\\) is the error term.\nA regression line is depicted in Figure 7.5.\n\n\n\n\n\nFigure 7.5: A Regression Best-Fit Line.\n\n\nRegression with multiple predictors—i.e., multiple regression—takes the form of Equation 7.21:\n\\[\ny = \\beta_0 + \\beta_1x_1 + \\beta_2x_2 + ... + \\beta_px_p + \\epsilon\n\\tag{7.21}\\]\nwhere \\(p\\) is the number of predictor variables.\nThe null hypothesis is that the the predictor variable(s) are not associated with the outcome variable. The alternative hypothesis is that the predictor variable(s) are associated with the outcome variable.\n\n7.5.5 Chi-Square Test\nThere are two primary types of chi-square tests:\n\nchi-square goodness-of-fit test\nchi-square test for association (aka test of independence)\n\nThe chi-square goodness-of-fit test evaluates whether a set of categorical data came from a specified distribution. The null hypothesis is that the data came from the specified distribution. The alternative hypothesis is that the data did not come from the specified distribution.\nThe chi-square test for association evaluates whether two categorical variables are associated. The null hypothesis is that the two variables are not associated. The alternative hypothesis is that the two variables are associated.\n\n7.5.6 Formulating Statistical Tests in Terms of Partitioned Variance\nMany statistical tests can be formulated in terms of partitioned variance.\nFor instance, the t statistic from the independent-samples t-test and the F statistic from ANOVA can be thought of as the ratio of between-group variance to within-group variance, as in Equation 7.22:\n\\[\nt \\text{ or } F = \\frac{\\text{between-group variance}}{\\text{within-group variance}}\n\\tag{7.22}\\]\nThe correlation coefficient can be thought of as the ratio of shared variance (i.e., covariance) to total variance, as in Equation 7.23:\n\\[\nr = \\frac{\\text{shared variance}}{\\text{total variance}}\n\\tag{7.23}\\]\nThe coefficient of determination (\\(R^2\\)) is the proportion of variance in the outcome variable that is explained by the predictor variables. ^2 is the proportion of variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables. The coefficient of determination and ^2 can be expressed as the ratio of variance explained in the outcome or dependent variable to the total variance in the outcome or dependent variable, as in Equation 7.24 and Equation 7.25:\n\\[\nR^2 = \\frac{\\text{variance explained in the outcome variable}}{\\text{total variance in the outcome variable}}\n\\tag{7.24}\\]\n\\[\neta^2 = \\frac{\\text{variance explained in the dependent variable}}{\\text{total variance in the dependent variable}}\n\\tag{7.25}\\]\n\n7.5.7 Critical Value\nThe critical value is the test value for a given test, above which the effect is considered to be statistically significant. The critical value for statistical significance for each test can be determined based on the degrees of freedom and alpha level. The degrees of freedom (df) refer to the number of values in the calculation of a test statistic that are free to vary.\n\nCodealpha &lt;- .05\nN &lt;- 200\nnGroup1 &lt;- 150\nnGroup2 &lt;- 150\nnumGroups &lt;- 4\nnumLevelsFactorA &lt;- 3\nnumLevelsFactorB &lt;- 4\nnumMeasurements &lt;- 4\nnumPredictors &lt;- 5\nnumCategories &lt;- 6\nnumRows &lt;- 5\nnumColumns &lt;- 2\n\n\n\n7.5.7.1 One-Sample t-Test\nFor a one-sample t-test, the degrees of freedom is in Equation 7.26:\n\\[\ndf = N -
