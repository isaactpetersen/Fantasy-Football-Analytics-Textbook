## About the Author {#sec-author}

I am an Assistant Professor in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences at the University of Iowa.
I am a licensed psychologist with expertise in child clinical psychology.
Why am I writing about fantasy football and data analysis?
Because fantasy football involves the intersection of two things I love: sports and statistics.

Through my training, I have learned the value of statistics for answering important questions that I find interesting.
In graduate training, I came to the realization that statistics are relevant not only for psychology and science, but also for domains that I enjoy as hobbies, including sports and fantasy sports.
I have played in a longstanding fantasy football league for over 20 years (since my junior year of high school) with old friends from high school.
I wanted to apply what I was learning about statistics to help others improve their performance in fantasy football and to help people—including those who might not otherwise be interested—to learn statistics.
So I began blogging online about the value of applying statistics to improve decision making in fantasy football.
Apparently, many people were interested in learning statistics when they could apply them to a domain that they find interesting like fantasy football.
My blog eventually became [FantasyFootballAnalytics.net](http://fantasyfootballanalytics.net), a website that uses advanced statistics to help people win their fantasy football leagues.

In terms of my `R` and statistics background, I have published many [peer-reviewed publications](https://developmental-psychopathology.lab.uiowa.edu/publications) that employ advanced statistical methods, have published a [book on psychological assessment](https://www.routledge.com/9781032413068) that includes applied examples in `R`, and have published [an `R` package](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/petersenlab/index.html) on the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN).

## Acknowledgments {#sec-acknowledgments}

I thank Dr. Benjamin Motz, who provided consultation and many helpful resources based on his fantasy football statistics class.
I also thank key members of [FantasyFootballAnalytics.net](http://fantasyfootballanalytics.net), including Val Pinskiy, Andrew Tungate, Dennis Andersen, and Adam Peterson, who helped develop and provide fantasy football-related resources and who helped sharpen my thinking about the topic.
I also thank Professor Patrick Carroll, who taught me the value of statistics for answering important questions.
